1,Can the <li> element contain content other than text?,"FAQ,HTML FAQ",q-a,12,"
Question
Can the <li> element contain content other than text? For example, can we have lists of videos or songs or hyperlinks or some combination of all three?
Answer
Yes we can! The <li> element can contain any element which is valid within the <body> tag. This means that we can have lists of videos, images, songs, hyperlinks, or any combination thereof. In fact, we can even have lists of lists!
","
Wow! I didn’t know the li element is so versatile.

yes, MDN always has good documentation so for example about <li>:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/li
we can see: permitted content flow content, then you can see what tags are flow content. Which are a lot

You can create an unordered list containing an ordered referencing an image of an ordered list containing an unordered list.

If this is possible then, does that mean the li element will contain attributes representing the song or image within its tag, or instead place the song or image contents outside its tag?

Newbie here: does the formatting of text (like in word with bold, italics, size, font, bullets, etc) carry over to html setup? or do you need to change it all again?  I ask this because in the lesson example, it seems like terming each line or bolded word is extra work if it’s already been done before in another program. Help me understand!




 knightjmcc:

… carry over to html setup?


No. Any character formatting will be lost on paste in unless by some fluke all the unrevealed markup is still embedded. One would expect that to not be the case. All the text will need to be marked up as required.

Sometimes when pasting from word doc to wordpress for example, the formatting is converted into html automatically. In that case you could copy the html code from there and use it elsewhere if needed. The converting isn’t always perfect though. I’d assume there are probably some online converters as well, as there are converters for excel to html table.

I had no idea <li> could be used for things other then text.

Technically all of HTML is text, whether in terms of markup, or the content itself. The MIME type for a web document is, type=""text/html""

@mtf Hello, I see that you are the most pro here, so here goes my question. I was wondering if in HTML you could render mathematical formulae or other stuff. It’s because I’ve worked with LaTeX which is also a markup language and thanks to Knuth and his invention of TeX I can easily type beautiful math and physics (if I insert the package). The thing is that I’ve heard about other math rendering in the computers that was before Knuth invented LaTeX (that’s why he invented it, bc he did not like the previous form of rendering maths on the computer). I think it was through UNICODE or something like that.
Sorry for my iliteracy and my bad english. I may be using incorrect terms and maybe the information is not 100% accurate. What you do think about all this?

If we want web facing pages to render math it’s likely we would need a license to use LaTeX or MathML since it does not come with browsers.

2,Why would raw text need a structure?,"FAQ,HTML FAQ",q-a,28,"
Question
Within the context of this exercise which defines HTML, why would raw text need a structure? Doesn’t it already have a grammatically defined structure?
Answer
While raw text might have a grammatically defined structure, this isn’t the type of structure we are referring to here. By carefully marking up the contents of a page, developers can create a hierarchy of information which serves several purposes:

it allows users scanning a site to quickly pick out the most important ideas.
it helps visually impaired users navigate the content of a page using special software.
it helps search engines pick out important keywords that might otherwise get lost in a sea of text.

","
what does raw text mean ??

This question is basically asking: why do I have to put in any code if I just want it to be what laymen would refer to as “regular” text (so, without anything fancy).
The answer is in two parts saying: 1) you need code for everything and 2) why exactly that is.
Hope that helps!

Lets say that it already has a pre-defined structure. The pre-defined structure is basic and simple. To create something more complicated it is better to add codes to change the original structure of text than to use the original one.

ya that is just confusing

ikr its so confusing

Raw text is the text that you are putting onto the page, which needs a structure because that tells it where to go - headings, indentations, subheadings, etc. are all built by the structure that you put the raw text into.

What is confusing about it? Is it the idea of raw text vs structures or the idea of raw texts at all? Think about it this way, when you read a newspaper is all the text the same size or in the same place? No. The “raw text” or writing is formatted with structures like headings and bylines that are of different sizes and in different places on the page. Just like with a newspaper, text on a website needs to be formatted so that it is readable and makes sense.

ok now it makes sense thank you

Thank you for your help 

The reason this seem confusing to some, is mostly because of the “word processor” expectation.
Meaning, if you been using any Office Suite, like MS Office, Libre Office, then you accustome to just typing content on the page and formatting things, then it look nice. Very easy and convenient.
But here’s the thing many don’t know, even word processors like MS Word have hidden/invisible characters on the page.It’s simply disable by default.
We as humans can see something is bold, a paragraph, etc, but the computer don’t.
It only know and do what we tell it do.
Tags allow the browser engine to recognize what you feeding it, so it knows then what it should do with it, and how to display it. consider it a command you giving the browser. You telling it to abide by certain rules/guidelines, instead of getting random results.
It not easy to grasp the concept at first, but click and drag builders also have to add these markup behind the scenes. programming languages have always been how developers give instructions to computers. we just created better software over time that blurred the line between human readable and machine code.

This is very useful, thank you! I am new to coding, and this just clarify a lots of terms and concepts I had problem understanding.

What does raw text actually mean?

redjester91 explains it perfectly above.
I’m just going to cut and paste their words here.



 redjester91:

Raw text is the text that you are putting onto the page, which needs a structure because that tells it where to go - headings, indentations, subheadings, etc. are all built by the structure that you put the raw text into.


Some found it confusing so they further explained raw text here.

Think about it this way, when you read a newspaper is all the text the same size or in the same place?

Just like with a newspaper, text on a website needs to be formatted so that it is readable and makes sense.



What has not been mentioned here is that the entire HTML document is raw text. The style sheet is raw text. The script is raw text.

Thanks for providing a very clear explanation!

okay so how does raw text work. and if it doesnt work what do i do

          basically the main function of HTML is to alter and display texts.so the structure of the raw text will alter the lay out of the website/text.
        
wow i just saw this and it helped out thanks dude makes sense.

Context like headings and paragraphs and stuff in that nature.

3,This exercise uses the `_blank` value to open pages in new tabs. Does the `target` attribute have other values?,"FAQ,HTML FAQ",q-a,13,"
Question
This exercise uses the _blank value to open pages in new tabs. Does the target attribute have other values?
Answer
Yes, there are 4 different values the target attribute can have: _self, _blank, _parent, or _top. These values specify a browsing context or the environment in which the browser will display a document. To learn about each of these values, check out Mozilla docs!
","
3 posts were merged into an existing topic: Do attributes need to be in a specific order?

What happens when you change the value of the attribute to _self, _parent, or _top? Tried it out in the index.html doc for brown bears but wasn’t able to see a visible difference.

This is a late reply, but to clarify, the only target attribute value that has any effect in a single browser window is _blank, which refers to a new tab or window. These are legacy attributes that apply to frameset, a very uncommon thing in today’s era now that we have CSS. Frames predated CSS.
Also of note, attributes have no order. They can be written in any order, though usually we like to see the id and class attributes out front, and in that order. That’s just for reading, though. The browser makes no distinction of ordering or attributes.

is this supposed to open a new window, or just open a new tab on my browser?

That depends upon how your browser is set. Out the box most browsers default to a new tab.

I am enjoying so much just for reading the top questions below each exercise… that’s really awesome!  :  

you have to make a connection with the attirbute and the class because the selector make a visible page




MDN Web Docs



: The Anchor element
The HTML a element (or anchor element), along with its href attribute, creates a hyperlink to other web pages, files, locations within the same page, email addresses, or any other URL.






what is difference between tab and window in a browser?

Very little. Tabs permit multiple windows in a single browser shell or frame, but each is a separate browser, all the same. The cannot even speak to each other.
In the early days there were no tabs, only new windows. I don’t even remember who created tabs first, NetScape or Mozilla, or the emerging Firefox. Seems they were around when Chrome appeared on the scene.

thank you for clarifying

Yeah totally, I could have specified better. That’s essentially what I meant by it being good practice to make a preferred determination. After all, many links in a given site are just more internal links within the same site, which is the use case I happened to have in mind when I wrote my comment. Absolutely, it is better for user retention to use targeting and have any external links opening in a new tab/window. I just meant to communicate that it’s not like one has to include the target attribute in order to have a link work at all, since it’ll work one way or another without it.

4,Why would we want to separate small pieces of content?,"FAQ,HTML FAQ","elements-structure,q-a",30,"
Question
This exercise says that <span> elements are used to “separate small pieces of content”. Why would we want to separate small pieces of content?
Answer
It’s not that we necessarily want to separate content so much as we want to “mark it up” so that we can target it more specifically. There are all kinds of reasons for targeting specific pieces of content. For example, we may wish to use CSS to style the <span> content differently than the other content of a page.
","
One such example is when coding a page with more than one human language.
<html lang=""en"">

and in the body of the document,
<p>Capitalism is predominantly conducted in private hands with the government 
taking a <span lang=""fr"" title=""let do"">laissez faire</span> stand on most 
matters of management.</p>

CSS
span[lang=""fr""] {
  font-style: italic;
  text-decoration: underline;
}


Note the use of the title attribute to provide an English language literal translation when the text is moused over.

Thanks! This kind of Q&A’s is way better to understand with examples like this.

Thank you for this detailed answer.

Sweet! Your explanation absolutely made my day 

thanks for this explanation…very good

very helpful answer.thanks!

MTF duuuuuuuude thanks for that example!

Extremely helpful example. Thanks

 Thanks  lot for this explanation, I'm enjoying very much this course

Agreed - thank you for your example explanation. I’m chuffed I can understand it!

Short and useful. Also, great job for providing example. Thanks

Throwing in with the crowd: That example is excellent and opens up a lot of understanding about things besides just the question at hand, while doing so in an elegant and easy to understand way. Thanks for writing it!

Perfecto, muchas gracias por la explicación!!

Hi! I’m a real beginner, so my question is: Since the text “laissez faire” is included in the code, and the translation was also, what was the point of the “lang=“fr”” within the span tags? Thanks!

To advise the user agent of a change of human language in the text. A screen reader will tell the user that they have encounted a language other than English, and if verbosity is not turned off, will read to them the translation in the title attribute.

Ohh…Thanks for your quick reply! I’ve hit a snag - verbosity? I know what the word means, but as of yet not encountered it in my experience with computing. So this has to do with screen reader integration. Is that where the “verbosity” setting is? Hmm. I think I need to learn a bit more about this.
So verbosity off, and the screen reader just says “Lazy Fair” or verbosity on and it will state aloud that there is a foreign word, and speak the translation?
Sorry if I sound like a total spaz. It’s just that I’m a total spaz.

verbosity, when turned on can be quite chatty, so a lot of users turn it off. In coding, verbosity refers to such things as in depth error message reporting, or it can even refer to code bloat. At any length, there is a lot being said.



 slabz:

So this has to do with screen reader integration. Is that where the “verbosity” setting is?


Yes. But not only screen readers depend upon this meta data, search engines do, too.



 slabz:

So verbosity off, and the screen reader just says “Lazy Fair” or verbosity on and it will state aloud that there is a foreign word, and speak the translation?


I can’t say with certainty. One expects the screen reader will advise of the change in human language, but will not read the title value.

Thank you so much for your help! I now understand that there are more things to consider besides the website just working for common browsers. Something about SEO I also learned, because I guess when needing that data for search engines, they’ll rate the quality of your site higher.
Very cool. Thanks for your help, mtf!




 slabz:

they’ll rate the quality of your site higher


There are over 200 criteria that SE’s use to rate/rank a page/site, with quality being pretty high up on that list.

5,What is the point of nesting the <p> element in a <div> element?,"FAQ,HTML FAQ",q-a,34,"
Question
In steps 1 and 2 of this exercise, both <p> elements display in the same exact way. As it doesn’t seem like anything special happened here, what is the point of nesting the <p> element in a <div> element?
Answer
In this case, this is done purely for demonstrative purpose. In the future you will find that <div> elements are often used to group related content. This can serve to give a page some added structure and to allow for more modular styling.
","
It is primarily for the content creator and used to distinguish between paragraphs and sets of content.

Can we use the div element in the following way?
<div>
<body>
</body>
</div>

If we cannot use it then please explain why

no, as we can see in the documentation:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/body
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/html
body must a child of html, the documentation shows the Permitted content and Permitted parents.

I’m just setting out on learning this myself, but if I’m right, I’d say this is done because a body can have multiple divisions, but divisions cannot have multiple bodies and therefore the multiple divisions must be contained within the body.

everything in the body is whats being shown on the screen on the webpage so having divisions in the inside would make sense right ?

There is a hierarchy of tags in html. The html tag itself is the overall ‘parent’ tag. Followed by:
head which is the header section of the page and then the body that includes everything else. Divs are inside the body tags.

When treated as having meaning, writing a number of paragraphs in a division is a way of telling the source reader that they are all grouped together. We don’t send a baker’s dozen out in the customer’s hands, we place them in a box, with wax paper between the layers so the frosting doesn’t stick to the paper.
Think back to what we learned about writing and outlining of essays going back to grade 8, and how that same process applied all the way through secondary and even tertiary education. HTML is a document just like that essay and the better we outline it, the easier it will be to interpret the source, and eventually present (which is a totally separate concern) the content. We give meaning to the content by how we structure it.

Hello,
Since head and body are siblings, is it correct  to write:
<head>Hello World</head>
<body>
<p>This is a page that.... etc</p> 

</body>
skipping totally <div> that was there for demo reasons?




 tinapapadimitriou:

is it correct to write:
<head> Hello World </head>


No, it is not. HEAD is not a content container. It is reserved for meta data that is not visible to the visitor. All page content belongs in the BODY.
The only visible content in the HEAD is the <title>Hello World</title> which appears in the window’s title bar, or tab, not on the page itself.
The HEAD is where we declare things like what is the document type and root element? What is the human readable language used in the document? What is the character encoding so user agents can parse correctly? What background resources are needed in the parsing and page draw processes and how do they relate to the page? What is the title of the page (already mentioned)? What special cataloging information is required for this document?
<DOCTYPE html>

The above tells a user agent that this has an HTML5 document type, with the root element being, <html></html>.
<html lang=""en"">

The above tells the user agent that the human readable language is English.
<head>
  <meta charset=""UTF-8"">
  <title>Hello World</title>
  <link rel=""stylesheet"" href=""styles.css"">
  <link rel=""author"" href=""http://www.example.com"">
</head>

Above we declare character encoding as UTF-8, the de facto standard adopted by the international web community. It is before the title so that any special characters are recognized and printable. We describe the relation and location of the external resource needed by this document; and, lastly we insert a link to the author’s own page or site. Not required, as such, but I included it as an example for rel, the relation attribute.
As for writing paragraphs directly into the BODY, that may be valid but it is not organized and can be wieldly to work with when it comes to presentation. Having page sections with their own containers makes short work of this, and makes the document easier to read and analyze (by search engines, for example).

I clarified a lot of things with the details that you covered Roy.
Μany, many thanks for your reply!

Errata: The doctype is not in the head, d’oh! And neither is the root element, <html> they can be seen above as being at the very start of the document, though.

OK, thanks for checking on this.

i always though that the point of using the <p></p> was for spacing sentances and or using it to imput words

Markup is for documenting content, not for spacing or presentation.

ohh woops thanks for correcting me

This is pretty late response, but i just want to say that was the best explanation i have ever read  thank you !

Well said.  It’s just like how the human body has multiple divisions: the digits (fingers and toes), the appendages (arms and legs), and the torso.

A more appropriate analalogy would be a tree which can have only one root, and one trunk. It can have many branches, both off the trunk and off the branches themselves. The content (text nodes) would be the leaves.

why do we use the div element and do we need it

6,Is it correct to say that the <body> element is nested within the <html> element?,"FAQ,HTML FAQ",q-a,22,"
Question
Is it correct to say that the <body> element is nested within the <html> element?
Answer
That is correct! The <html> tag is the root element of every page and it should always have <head> and <body> child elements. The <head> and <body> elements are siblings to each other and children to the <html> parent.
","
To add to this, there is one other element permitted to be a direct child of <html></html> which is more commonly found in either the <head></head> after CSS links, or in the <body></body> element at the very bottom…
<script></script>

It may appear after the </body> tag, and is valid, though not typical.
Eg.
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang=""en"">
  <head>
    
  </head>
  <body>
    
  </body>
  <script src=""""></script>
  <script>
    // JS code
  </script>
</html>


Are elements also functions? or do they fall under both function and variable?




 mcandrewd:

Are elements also functions?


No, they are HTMLElement objects that make up the nodes from which the DOM is constructed. Are not variables, either. Both functions and variables are properties of the scripting language, usually JavaScript, but it could also be Python, Ruby, etc.

i am so confused :(

so <head>, <body> and <script> are all children of <html>, correct?

Yes and no. The convention is to write the script tag inside either/or both head and body. While browsers might accept a script outside of the head/body elements, the specification recommends,

Permitted parents Any element that accepts metadata content, or any element that accepts phrasing content.

The HTML root element can only have two children… HEAD and BODY.

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/html


Do we have HTML tree diagram {memory Diagram}

Last I recall there was one at the beginning of the HTML course.
In general,
<html>
|
<head> - <title> - <meta> - <link> - <style> - <script> - … - </head>
|
<body> - <div> - <h1> - <p> - … - </body>
|
</html>

So the src="" "" part is that how you draw the source code(Java, Python, CSS, etc)
and the  does that part even matter? will the computer not understand it if you use, say Spanish?

The src attribute is critical since that is how we tell the browser the URL of the file we wish to request.
src=""js/script.js""

The above requests the script.js file which is housed in the relative folder, js.

Thanks for all of your insight, man.  Excited to learn!

You have answered one part of the question. But what he is saying is true. If you specify in the <html lang=""en"">, is the html going to “understand” what is written in a .js file in Spanish or another language? Regards, I’ve seen you are the most pro here in Codeacademy :p.




 pa_u_los:

is the html going to “understand” what is written in a .js file in Spanish or another language?


HTML does not have to understand script. The browser uses a different engine to parse the document and build the DOM. lang=""en"" tells the user agent that the human readable language is English.
Scripting uses another engine to parse, interpret and compile script. CSS is also another API. These two operate on the DOM, not the document itself.

does this mean that the script tag and div tag are siblings then?

A sibling relationship has nothing to do with tags. It refers to two elements that have the same parent.




 mtf:

there is one other element permitted to be a direct child of <html></html>





 mtf:

The HTML root element can only have two children… HEAD and BODY.


Hi, I am still confused about these two quotes which seem to contradict each other.  Admittedly, for <HTML> element, the Permitted content are <head> element and <body> element. When the <script> element directly nested inside the <HTML> element, if the <script> element is not considered a child of the <HTML> element, what’s the real relationship between them?



 mtf:

Permitted parents Any element that accepts metadata content , or any element that accepts phrasing content .


BTW, could you please say more to clarify the reason introducing the metadata content and phrasing content? I have noticed that the <script> element belonging to the metadata content and phrasing content.




 mtf:

A sibling relationship has nothing to do with tags. It refers to two elements that have the same parent.


When <script></script> appear in the <body></body>  element, can I assume the <script> element and <div> element are siblings?

Any elements that are both direct children are siblings, regardless what tags they are comprised of.
If we read the specs, we find that even HEAD and BODY elements are optional. We can put our document right between the HTML tags and it will still be valid markup. Not entirely practical on a web facing page, but useful if we are inserting snippets with AJAX. The snippets will be HTML, but lacking a head and body.
When we need to include meta data we will need a HEAD, and BODY naturally follows.

I don’t see any visual or sectional changes to the text when I add the <div> tags. Is there  supposed to be some change in appearance? If not, what’s the point of this exercise if we cannot see the changes take place during the <div> exercise?
","
div (short for division) allows us to divide our page into different sections, to position this sections. Divs are very useful. The change might not be the most visual one, doesn’t make it less useful.
if we only used text, everything would just be from top to bottom. Look at this forum, imaging where divs might be (to divide different replies for example), or to place the scroll bar on the right hand side of the page and staying there even though we are scrolling through the replies.

Thanks for the thorough explanation! I understand the utility of div now, even if the visual changes aren’t readily apparent.




FAQ: Learn HTML Elements - Intro to HTML - Divs


div (short for divider)


Which implies a border or horizontal rule.
Short for division, implies a container.
DIVisions have no height, but come with width: 100% by default. Their height grows automatically as content is inserted. They can be set to a fixed height that triggers a scroll bar when the content overflows the allowed container size.

Thanx for this reply, it’s helped to increase my undertanding of the “div” tag

Thanx mtf for this angle of explanation concerning “div” tags. am really learning… yaaayyy

Thank you mtf, I am getting a better understanding of “containers”. Neat!

Most visual changes and usage of the  tag appear with CSS code, however, I find the <div> tag is useful also in coding only in HTML. It’s usefulness in html code come to group HTML elements for easier code readability. But a comment would do the same goal, so I’m not really sure.
Regardless, here is an example:
<div>

  <div>
    <h1>Book of the Brown Bears</h1>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2>Species</h2>
    <h3>Polar Bears</h3>
    <h3>Mountain Bears</h3>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2>Features</h2>
    <h3>Small Rounded Ears</h3>
    <h3> Shaggy Hair</h3>
    <h4>Short Tails</h4>
  </div>

</div>



Very helpful reply. Thank you

You will appreciate the importance of divs when you start targeting sections to style…even right inside HTML, we can’t thank divs enough. I’m sure you’ll discover this yourself down the way. You will learn of IDs etc. Don’t worry. Just continue the lesson in the understanding that divs are used for sectioning elements and later targeted and their children and descendants styled together as a unit/section.

Nice example! Thank you so much!

What a useful comment… Thank you.

Are divisions used as the indentations of a new paragraph like in an essay? If not? Why are they necessary in the code? I’m new and I just want to know please.

Thanks for this example! I am new to coding and now I understand why divs make a difference. Great example!

No, divisions aren’t strictly necessary, as they have no visible appearance. What they do is mainly to help you style the page better.
For example, you may want to contain part of your page in one <div> tag and another part in another <div> tag. If you do this, you can give each <div> a unique id to help you style elements in different <div>s differently.
I hope this helps!

The divisions can also be used for positioning (unless that is what you mean by styling?)
if you make a website, to get the look you are after, you most certainly need divisions, for the structure, layout and positioning.

Yeah, I was including positioning in styling. Thanks for clarifying!

Thank you very much!
Very good explanation.

Merci pour votre explication ! très utile pour mieux comprendre.

This proved quite useful , thanks !

8,Does the <li> tag always have to be nested within the <ul> tag?,"FAQ,HTML FAQ",q-a,9,"
Question
Does the <li> tag always have to be nested within the <ul> tag?
Answer
The <li> element can be a direct child of either the <ul> or the <ol> elements but it should never exist outside of either of these parent elements.
","
the  tag will be placed inside the  tag because the  tag mean listed items  and that helps you organize your unlisted items.  
 help organize all of the items after the unlisted items.



what is an <ol> element?

SInce ‘ul’ is unorganised list, ‘ol’ must be organised list IMO.

ul stands for “Unordered List” and ol stands for "" Ordered Lists"" except that each list item is numbered.
while li element will show the lists like this:

List item 1
List item 2
List item 3

A ol element will show the lists like this:

List item 1
List item 2
List item 3





 rubyslayer42889:

should never exist outside of either of these parent elements.


The Living Standard also includes the <menu></menu> element, which also has LI as direct children.



 sarahzeidi7926712521:

each list item is numbered


By default they are numbered from 1 to n, but we can also specify letters, lower or upper case, or Roman numerals, also upper or lower case. We can also specify the starting character.

https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/grouping-content.html#the-ol-element

Scroll down that page to find UL, LI, and MENU.

I notice that I can leave aside the end tag for list items () and everything seems to work fine. Is it really necessary to type an end tag for list items?

Best practices recommend including both tags; however, W3C has gone along with omitting the endtag. This also applies to paragraphs. Let the situation dictate, and keep it localized and well contained.

Hi! Why does it always have to be nested, or what would go wrong if it isn’t? I played around with the code and previews in the Elements and Structure exercise in the Introduction to HTML lectures, and figured that UL means that a list is coming up and indents the succeeding text, while LI makes a bullet point for the text. By this, if you were to create an unordered list that you wanted sitting flush with the rest of the text rather than indented, you can make a list with the LI tags, and omit the UL tag, it seems? With this, why would it be bad if we didn’t list LI tag inside of the UL tag?
Thanks!

Question
How does the browser know what language other documents are written in? For example, why doesn’t css need a doctype?
Answer
DOCTYPE declarations are only required for html based documents. Other JavaScript or CSS files are actually loaded into the page with <link> or  tags. These tags signify the file type to the browser thereby allowing the browser to properly parse the file.
","
Why is DOCTYPEtag needed to identify the file is HTML when the file already starts with 
and ends
</html>
Isn’t this requirement tautological?

There are different doctypes for different versions of HTML—all of which still use the .html file extension and the <html></html> tag pair. For the current version, the doctype declaration has been simplified to:
<!DOCTYPE html>
but this is still telling the browser what version is being used (HTML5). If you were to look at a doctype on an older HTML document, then you might see a longer doctype like:
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC ""-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN"" ""http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd"">
Even though the HTML5 doctype declaration is dramatically simplified, it is still required so that the browser knows which version of HTML is being used. Once it knows, then it is able to render the document in “strict mode.” If no doctype is declared, then it can still tell that the document is HTML based on the file extension and <html></html> tag pair, but since it does not know which version of HTML is being used, it renders the document in “quirks mode.”

Very useful & nice instrections

There are not only different doctypes, for example if an HTML document happens to be written in HTML 4.01 or in XHTML, but the doctype is also a standard that lets the browser know that the following is an HTML 5 document. It just gives it a little help.
In fact, you will find that the browser will usually display the page just fine, even without the doctype in it. But just because it works, doesn’t mean it is right. Besides, that it can have some unforseen issues, as each browser goes different when it comes to how to interpret elements, tags, style, etc. when it is not properly declared.

why does’nt the doctype show anything on the screen

Because it is not meant for the screen, but for the user agent. It’s not even in the HTML. It tells the browser the ROOT ELEMENT, <html></html> which is where the HTML is. The part we see on the screen is all in the BODY element. Everything in the HEAD is metadata to help with parsing and indexing.

I just want to second mtf’s explanation as that is how I interpreted it as well.

This really explains it, nice!

CSS and JavaScript are used within a HTML document for styling and calculations, however the document remains an HTML document. The doctype simply describes what HTML you are using in the document.
 indicates the current standard HTML (HTML5). CSS and JavaScript are then used within the HTML document without changing the sort of doctype it is.
        
This might sound like a silly question and off topic but would the DOCTYPE HTML declaration be the parent of the the head element?




 dev_biker:

be the parent of the the head element?


No, it is not even HTML. The document root is the <html/> element, which can have <head/> and <body/> elements as its direct children.
"
10,Why are some tags self-closing but others are not?,"FAQ,HTML FAQ",q-a,19,"
Question
Why are some tags self-closing (img, br, etc.)  whereas others are not?
Answer
The important distinction between self-closing tags and all other tags is that self-closing tags represent void elements. Void elements like img and br cannot contain any content. All other tags may (but are not required to) contain content.
","
What does the abbreviation ‘src’ stand for?

It stands for “Source”, as in the location in which the file is located. In this situation the local or web address in which the image is located.




 rubyslayer42889:

img and br cannot contain any content


img and br cannot contain any content，
we can see""""in  No.14, It’s content!

Content is defined I believe on the second slide of this section as “information between the opening and closing tag.” This does not include attributes (like alt) which are solely defined within the opening tag!

If we need to define a content in terms of it’s START - END then, besides the start point we have to declare also the end point.
e.g.

We declare a title, then we have start & end point for it,   <title> </title>

We write a paragraph just for others to see, then we use <p> and close it with </p>

We declare a specific piece of this text for e.g. to be in French. We then use<span> & close it as </span>

We declare some words to be in bold or italics, again we have start & end of the text we want to format, so <strong> & </strong> <em> & </em>

We group elements, again we need to declare which items are to be grouped together. So again,  we have an open close case <div> </div>. Same when we create lists, ordered or unordered ones.

Whereas,

We insert a line break in a specific point, so we say <br>  once. A line break is going to be formatted, without any other need.
We insert an image in a specific point, so we say <img> once. Again, there’s no need to close anything, as we say <br> and <img> are self-closing tags.


It makes sense, what is confusing is that we insert a video in a specific point, so we should say <video> once, but we have to close it instead. 

wow, it is easy standard for recognizing those two!

Every rule have it’s exceptions 

So when it says “self-closing tags represent void elements […] like img and br cannot contain any content”. I’m slightly confused because isn’t the alt attribute in the img element in a way, content? It’s just not seen on the screen? Because it can be heard, right?
Lastly, if that’s the case, I also just wanted to know how videos contain content, and how that differs from the alt attribute…
I hope I’m kind of making sense here. This question took some time to put into words.

You’re confusing what ‘content’ means in HTML.
With any HTML tag the ‘content’ is what appears between the opening and closing tag:
<openingTag>content</closingTag>
For example:
<p>Some random text.</p>
<img> is called self closing because there is no closing tag with content in the middle.
In this example:
<img src=""myHouse.gif"" alt=""My House"">
src and alt are attributes that have values assigned, but neither is referred to as ‘content’.
Hope this helps!

why post is still going in flag!!!




 course0029984303:

post is still going in flag!!!


Any content between the opening and closing  <video>  tags is  fallback content . This content is displayed only by browsers that don’t support the  <video>  tag.

yeah, it’s a pretty good explanation, but the video thing or i may say exception has to have an explanation 




Self-closing vs. non self-closing tags



Why is the img tag self-closing but the video tag is not?

An image element has no content, only attributes, src , alt , title , width , height , etc.
A video element may have content, such as a text message if the video does not render:
Your device does not support video.

This will take more reading to confirm, especially whether or not a placeholder image can be used in place of the video applet if it does not render, or until it is activated to render.
https://dev.w3.org/html5/spec-author-view/video.html#video 


To add on to that the video tag can also take a few sources so that it can be compatible with many browsers/devices



MDN Web Docs



: The Video Embed element
The HTML Video element (video) embeds a media player which supports video playback into the document. You can use video for audio content as well, but the audio element may provide a more appropriate user experience.





Are they any other exceptions that need clearing up?

yes, in the HTML DOCUMENT STANDARDS when they were talking about making an image clickable.
the exercice was about, (transform the image on your page into a link by wrapping the image element with an anchor element.)
and that’s exactly what i did, but i forget about the closing anchor ( < /a > )

but it worked anyway, without the closing anchor, so i just want to know why.
thanks for your help btw.
cheers.

Hi Jaadani
Certain errors in HTML can run normally as the browser will render correctly (it corrects your code)
In the case of a hyperlink if you don’t close it then the rest of the elements until there’s an end point (could be another hyperlink) will also be wrapped in the hyperlink.
Hope this makes sense.




 midlindner:




‘Video not supported’ says it all on the difference between image and video. It makes sense to me. Thasnks.

Why the “>” of the opening video tag is after “controls”?

I mean, for example for text we use the full opening tag, then the content and then the closing tag
So I do not really understand because even for video is not something like that.
Hope make sense what I am saying
"
11,Why doesn’t the controls attribute need a value?,"FAQ,HTML FAQ",q-a,1,"
Question
Why doesn’t the controls attribute need a value, like all the other attributes we have seen thus far?
Answer
Unlike the other attributes you have seen thus far, the controls attribute is an example of a “Boolean attribute”. Boolean attributes have true/false conditions. Including a boolean attribute  within an element signifies the condition is true (or on) while omitting it signifies the condition is false (or off).
In this case, including the controls attribute within the opening video tag means “turn the controls on”. We might even say that this is the “truthy” condition.

12,Why does the content of a web page need to be described with tags?,"FAQ,HTML FAQ",q-a,4,"
Question
This exercise says, “Tags provided by HTML exist to organize and describe the content of web pages”. Why does the content of a web page need to be described with tags?
Answer
The browser needs to know what type of content it is looking at in order to display it properly. What’s more, other software (screen readers, search engines, etc.) needs to know this information so that they can properly perform functions like indexing a page or navigating through it.
","
The answer appears to have a typo. I believe the first line should read, ""The browser needs to know what type of content it is looking at in order to display it properly.

Question
There are so many tags! How can I ever remember them all?
Answer
There are quite a few tags but try not to get too overwhelmed here. While it is a good idea to skim through the list shared in this exercise, there is no need to try to memorize them all. The more web sites you make the more familiar you will become with the elements you have at your disposal.
It’s important to realize that certain tags are used more frequently than others and even seasoned web developers have to look tags up from time to time.

At one point the Mozilla docs are referenced on HTML. They say to include the <meta charset=""utf-8"">  in the header element, why did we not cover this element in the HTML intro? “this element sets the character set your document should use to UTF-8, which includes most characters from the vast majority of human written languages. Essentially it can now handle any textual content you might put on it. There is no reason not to set this, and it can help avoid some problems later on.” – from Mozilla




 scriptrockstar27793:

why did we not cover this element in the HTML intro?


Good question, and one which I’ve been asking all along. For some unknown reason, the HTML course authors have neglected any discusssion of character set declaration, yet insist upon using type=""text/css"" and type=""text/javascript"" under the HTML5 doctype when they are moot.
I’m assumng that they don’t wish to get bogged down in the technical discussion around important metadata. A good example of why this is avoided can be deduced from the difficulty many learners have with understanding the <title> element. Learners will only spend so many hours on a course, and it would appear more expediant to skip over some of the details, deferring to the user to pick up on them at some later time.
Eventually the FAQ will likely cover questions of accessibility and important metadata, and I can confess to harping about these developer concerns in Q&A replies over the years. Once a learner reads of the need for certain elements, they cannot unread that information, only choose to use it, or ignore it.

HTML and the CSS precursors are still in use around the world, where technology has not “caught up”. While the course seems to be attempting to use HTML5 and CSS3 because they are the foundational programs new devs will use for their own work, they will in all likelihood run into programming used only by deprecated levels of each. Depending on the program(er) whose code they will read, maintain, and/or normalize, they will most likely run into this code.
As a developer, I keep references near at hand for such older code. Learning to research is a fundamental of good development. But this is a beginning course for new developers. I think we should remember that, and keep to the present course instruction to avoid unnecessary (or even necessary) confusion at this point. Learning is a never ending, constant process in our profession. It is learning to learn, how to think, and how to pro-actively (and prophylactically) code for others to read that we all must develop as a second sense.

When I went and looked at the list of codes, I almost wanted to pass out! Made me realize that I still have sooooo much more to do and to learn. Thank you for the encouragement!

i thought the same thing!!!

For real. They should add this in the course to avoid confusion later on when people’s websites doesn’t work.

Question
If both <br> and <br/> are valid syntaxes, which one should I use?

Ive been reading about html and xhtml, wouldnt it be better to use <br/>  or  <br></br> in case we need it to be read by xml readers?

HTML5 does not require empty elements to be closed. But if you want stricter validation, or if you need to make your document readable by XML parsers, you must close all HTML elements properly.
W3Schools


HTML5 is essentially HTML 4.1 when served with the default MIME type, text/html.  Under this MIME type the browser never parses XML so there is no need to close void elements.
It is when we explicitly serve the document with an XML MIME type, then HTML5 is equivalent to XHTML which must conform to XML syntax. That means all void elements must be closed. HTML5 came along at a time when browser quirks were being ironed out and that allowed it to remove the space before the slash that was needed in XHTML. Hence,
<br/>

and
<br />

are the same thing, and both are valid.
Generally speaking, a production site that serves XML conforming HTML5 will have its server configured to  send that MIME type in the header of pages served out so that no declaration is needed in the document.
As for best practices, subjectivity should be avoided, as it tends to introduce bias. The HTML 4 standard should be applied across the board and closing void tags set aside when not explicitly required.
<br>
<hr>
<input>
<img>

says it all. This document is text/html. Closing these tags will not impress anybody.

I agree that in HTML5, void elements should not contain a space and/or a forward slash at the end, as per the W3C.  It’s only required in XHTML and XML.
Regarding being consistent with the way we write our tags, I’ve noticed that in Codecademy’s lessons, the image element is always closed with a space and a slash like <img /> while all the other self-closing elements in the document are written without the space and slash, e.g., <meta> or <link> or <br>.
I can see how this could be confusing to beginning students of web development or anyone learning HTML.
I like to keep things as simple as possible when writing code, so I always omit the slash and/or space when closing void elements.  For example:
<meta>
<link>
<br>
<img>

By the way, the terms void element, empty element, and self-closing tag all mean the same thing.

Thanks  you for help…again 

Thank U~~:kissing_heart:

hmmmm…confused a little bit…

somos 2, pero bueno, a echarle ganas!!

I think if XML inside your Website we should use  else it’s fine whatever you use

Just so that it’s 100% clear for everyone, the W3C HTML5 spec explicitly states that either syntax is fine. (At least, as of January 2019, anyway)
From the spec:

In HTML, these elements have a start tag only. The self-closing tag syntax may be used.


A Self-closing tag is a special form of start tag with a slash immediately before the closing right angle bracket. These indicate that the element is to be closed immediately, and has no content.


In both HTML and XHTML, within each tag, whitespace is permitted after the tag name…Some authors choose to include a space before the slash in the self-closing tag.

So according to the W3C, <br>, <br/>, and <br /> are all valid HTML. You’re free to use whichever you prefer.
Personally, I prefer all of my tags to close. It feels more consistent, to me. It bugs me to see sporadic unclosed tags throughout a document full of otherwise closed tags. I understand that not everyone shares my phobia, though. 
So, by all means, omit the slash if that’s your preference. But it’s perfectly valid to include it if you want to.




 nemo242:

It feels more consistent, to me.


Subjective reasoning has no place in the specifications. Style guides are just that, guides.
Bottom line, if the page is being served as text/html then we do not need XML compliant markup.
There is one case where we must use XML compliant tags, JSX. What that suggests is that JSX has XML behind the scenes.




 mtf:

ubjective reasoning has no place in the specifications.


 Dunno what to say. Take it up with the W3C?
Because, as of now, their specification clearly states that either syntax is valid, without giving an opinion as to which should be used. The spec leaves that decision entirely up to the author. Whether or not that should be the case is up to the W3C.
And to clarify, in my original post, I wasn’t so much responding to your earlier comment about best practices, but rather to the later poster who stated that “void elements should not contain a space and/or a forward slash at the end, as per the W3C .” Because the W3C says nothing of the sort. Per the W3C spec, using self-closing tags for void elements is valid. I just wanted to make that clear to everyone.




 nemo242:

Dunno what to say. Take it up with the W3C?


The specification does not speak in subjective terms. What we feel has no bearing. Nothing to take up with W3C, they state clearly that we do not need to close void elements. That only applies when the document has a MIME type of ""text/html"". If it is served with ""application/xml"" then it MUST conform to XML requirements.




 mtf:

they state clearly that we do not need to close void elements.


Correct. The spec clearly states that we do not need to close void elements. But it also explicitly states that we may close them. That’s all I was saying. And that it’s my preference to close them, which is still valid HTML. And if anyone else’s preference is to close them, they may also do so whilst still writing valid HTML.

Which is moot. We may choose to do as we wish, but the choice itself should be non-subjective. If we use a style guide that suggests we always close them, then stick to the guide without letting personal feelings or preferences come into it. I agree that we should strive toward consistent usage. Once we enter an organization, it will be their style guide that applies, not our personal choice.

I don’t think it is moot. The spec treats both options as equally valid. That is an objective fact. And if both options are equally valid, then the choice as to which one we use is inherently subjective.
You say that self-closing tags are unnecessary for text/html docs and are not part of the HTML 4.1 spec from which the HTML5 spec is mostly derived. If I’m reading you correctly, you think that those are the most important facts to be considered, therefore the best practice is to omit self-closing tags unless otherwise required. That is a perfectly valid opinion. But it is a subjective opinion. You’ve made a value judgement about what you think is most important to consider in this decision.
I say that self-closing tags are valid HTML, were folded into the HTML5 spec from the XHTML spec, and that using them maintains consistency with every other tag in an HTML document, and maintains consistency with other markup languages web devs are likely to encounter, namely XML and JSX, which require self-closing tags. To me, those are the most important facts to consider, therefore the best practice is to use self-closing tags. Using them is one less thing I have to think about when I’m bouncing between documents and languages in a project, which allows me to better focus on larger problems. That is my value judgement and it is no more, nor no less, subjective than yours.

After reading my original comment from last year, it occurred to me I had (in haste) made an error in punctuation (not in wording) that resulted in the error you pointed out as seen below:
Original: ""I agree that in  HTML5 ,  void elements  should not contain a space and/or a forward slash at the end, as per the W3C. It’s only required in  XHTML  and XML.""
Corrected: I agree that in  HTML5 ,  void elements  should not contain a space and/or a forward slash at the end. As per the W3C, it’s only required in  XHTML  and XML.

A mistake?? On the internet?? Noooooooo! 
It’s all good. Happens to all of us.

I’m not an expert, whatsoever. I’m actually studying HTML as a total beginner. However, I would like to comment on this debate. Both of you have arguments. Allow me to express just an observation.
Though HTML allows one to use or not use closing tags for empty elements, the idea is not about what you are allowed to do but what is the minimum requirement in order for one to do what he wants.
Like mrf explained, in a style guide there shouldn’t be any subjective choice in order to create. The fact that you can be subjective it’s another story. A guide should be objective, and you can be objective when you follow the minimum requirement. In this case there is no need for a closing tag when you have an empty element. One cannot be subjective when he follows the minimum requirements because he wouldn’t be able to do what he wants otherwise. So, it’s an objective aspect.
The fact that you want to have closing tags everywhere because it helps you is a subjective choice as you are not asked to do that in the first place as a minimum requirement. I think it’s useful to have consistency too but that’s another story.
I think this problem is not a HTML one but a logical one. This is why I dared to write. I’m a total beginner otherwise.

The way is see it, to meet the required minimum in both XML and HTML is to close tags. You´re meeting both minimums and dont have to remember whether you´re working with HTML or XML. Is it more work - barely, does it bring any errors - no, its it against rules - no, works it as failsafe - yes. Win-Win for all.
Minimum argument is bit problematic for me, as minimum is subjective and different file by file, system by system. What I want is go above and beyond and make users happy

15,What is the difference between content that is inline vs blocks of content?,"FAQ,HTML FAQ","elements-structure,q-a",3,"
Question
This exercise discusses dividing your content into blocks. What is the difference between content that is inline vs blocks of content?
Answer
As the exercise alludes to, there exists block-level elements (<div>, <p>, etc.)  and inline-level elements (<span>, etc). One of the big differences between these two types of elements is that a block element will take up the entire width of its containing element. This means that by default <div> and <p> elements will push sibling elements to a new line or section of the page.
On the other hand, inline elements make more conservative use of space. They take up only as much space as they need and will not force surrounding content to a new line.

Question
Rather than using a url to link to images that exist on the web, can I link to images that are stored locally on my own computer?
Answer
Yes you can! In fact, developers often work locally before pushing their code to production. When dealing with assets like images, we will often want to include them in a folder which will also contain our HTML document. With a properly arranged directory or folder structure, we can create a path which points to our image and is relative to our HTML document. In this scenario, this relative path will be the value of the <img> src attribute.
For more information about relative and absolute paths, take a look at this chapter.
","
Really helpful tips for future organize.

Supa, Dupa helpful hints and tips!!!

thank you very much .

If the image is stored locally, and you have website live, will the image be cached onto the website or will always be sourced from the local file. For example if you were to delete the image from your hard drive, would that mean people viewing the website would not see the picture?

The local drive and the remote server are independent. There is no connection between the local drive and the server so anything deleted from one will not be affected on the other.

Must there always be ("") after src and before the URL and at the end ?

To promote best practice and trust less to the various and myriad user agent’s imperatives and ability to fill in the missing bits, we ought make it a habit to always delimit attribute values with quotes. This becomes more apparent when we begin generating HTML with other programs.
Granted, browsers have always been pretty lenient and really do try their best to make sense of the markup during parsing. It’s a long shot though whether the vendor your most important customer is using will be so trustworthy. Don’t leave things to chance. We are the imperative stipulators, not the browsers.
<img src=""my_image.png"">

As a rule, I always use double quotes on attributes and single quotes in most code. That way an HTML string can be written in single quotes in the script that is generating it, and the attributes in double quotes without needed escapement. The double quotes are treated as printable characters.
Anyhow, that may be a ways down the road but now is the time to entrench good habits. This is one of those habits that will go you steadfast all the long way.

“For more information about relative and absolute paths, take a look at this chapter.”
The “chapter” link is broken.

if you pointed the src to a folder in the same directory as the .html file named pictures would that work?
for example a folder structure as such:
My HTML Website Folder
  index.html
  pictures folder
    headshot.jpg

and a index.html as such:
<body>
  <h1>My Name</h1>
  <img src=""/pictures folder/headshot.jpg"" >
  <p>Hi, I'm My Name. I like fishing, hiking, and biking.</p>
</body>


Hey @omnipresentaura
Why don’t you try it? I think the best way to learn these things is from hands on experience because what if we’re wrong? I could just right up say yes, it is able to(which I’m pretty sure it is), but that way, nothing will be learned and I could be wrong.
To answer your question, yes you are able to do that, but I encourage you to try this stuff out on your own as well, because when trying out new things in coding, you can learn so much more than you started out trying to learn.




 omnipresentaura:

“/pictures folder/headshot.jpg”


If we assume that index.html is in a local folder on your machine, then it should be a relative URL, not an absolute one.
""pictures/headshot.jpg""

or,
""./pictures/headshot.jpg""

Any URL that starts with ""/"" points to the site root, which on your local machine is C:\. On a web server the site root is where the home page resides. In that case, and assuming the pictures folder is also on the site root then an absolute URL is fine.
Be sure not to have space characters in your folder or file names. Use underscores or dashes.
""/pictures_folder/headshot.jpg""




 mtf:

The local drive and the remote server are independent. There is no connection between the local drive and the server so anything deleted from one will not be affected on the other.


Hi, Roy. I have two questions.
In terms of this topic, if the image is stored in the local drive, will the remote server actually store all of the data(including everything of this website, like HTML, CSS, Javascript and the same image copy) in the related database? In other words, the remote server completely backed up the information in my computer hard drive. When others access this website I created myself, the remote server will pull the information from the related database to respond back. This process has nothing to do with my computer, and deleting this image from my hard drive will not affect the website. is my understanding correct?  
In addition to this, what if my computer is the server for the website I created myself? In this case, if I delete the image from my hard drive, would that mean people viewing the website can not see this picture?

Please do not confuse the hosting platform (the namespace where your site resides) with a database (the repository where your data resides). We can have a fully functioning website without a database. HTML is on the very surface, static. It’s raw text that is later parsed for recognizable keywords that can be tokenized. It’s how BASIC used to work in the 8-bit environment. You’d type the keyword and then peek where it got inserted in memory and always it would be a two byte token. Probably just imagining that HTML works like this, so take it as you might.
As for where our own computer fits this picture? It doesn’t. It is an FTP or other client that occasionally feeds new data to the server. All the other data is coming from the users.

what if my computer is the server for the website I created myself?


Not plausible. It wouldn’t even take a DDOS attack to bring it down. It’s own hardware deficiencies would do it.




 mtf:

The local drive and the remote server are independent. There is no connection between the local drive and the server so anything deleted from one will not be affected on the other.


Hi Roy, could you please explain this in detail? I wonder why there is no connection between the local drive and the server. And if the image is stored in the local drive and I delete the image later from my hard drive, how the client can see that image when browsing  the webpage?
I’m sorry that your previous explanation is a little difficult to understand. I’m still a newbie 

We do not serve images from our own local machine. Using an FTP client (or some other secure client) we upload images to the server. It is the files installed on the remote site that are served to visitors. Once the files are on the server they are there permanently, or until they are removed from there. What we do with the files on our local drive has zero effect on the server. They have no connection.

That’s really helpful. Thank you   

Now, Here is some things need to discuss…
I am using win10 OS…And here you can link your local image using 2 methods…
1. dot.html file and your picture are in the same folder. Then code is like this…
<img src=""IMG_5124.jpg"">

2. dot.html and your picture are in a different folder but…the folder is the sub-folder where you put the HTML file…E.g:
<img src=""img/IMG_5124.jpg"">

Unfortunately, when I put the picture in another drive it doesn’t render in firefox, chrome etc.

17,This exercise nests anchors within `<li>` elements. Wouldn’t it make more sense to make the entire `<li>` a clickable anchor by nesting the `<li>` in anchor tags instead?,"FAQ,HTML FAQ",q-a,5,"
Question
This exercise nests anchors within <li> elements. Wouldn’t it make more sense to make the entire <li> a clickable anchor by nesting the <li> in anchor tags instead?
Answer
This does make sense. However, this would be invalid syntax and should be avoided. As specified in mozilla docs, <li> elements should always be direct children of either <ol>, <ul> or the experimental <menu> tags.
","


Indeed, and i did that because i assumed the question meant to wrap <li> inside anchor tags which produced same output?
Why is this invalid syntax?

LI is a block level element. A is an inline element. We contain inline elements within block level elements, not the other way around.
We must also keep in mind that the specification is a recommendation, not a rule. It is a guide to building well formed documents that validate and conform to usability and accessibility guidelines.

18,How do I change the font size within table cells?,"FAQ,HTML FAQ","tables,q-a",41,"
Question
How do I change the font size within table cells?
Answer
You do this with CSS, which adds style to the structure of HTML.  If you haven’t learned CSS, don’t worry, you can with the Learn CSS course!  If you’re taking a Path, CSS usually follows HTML.
To change the font size of the data contained within table cells you can use the th, td selector along with the font-size property within a .css file. For example, a CSS rule geared at changing the font size within all cells might look like this:
 th, td {
    font-size: 18px;
  }

If you are having trouble finding where to put this, check the tabs at the top of the coding window. You should see two different files: index.html and style.css. You should be familiar with index.html as this is where coding for previous html lessons has taken place. In style.css, you’ll see css code you may not be familiar with yet, thats okay for now just take a peek and add the font-size code.
If that all sounds confusing to you, don’t worry, it soon won’t and you can return to this question later to further understand it.
","
A post was split to a new topic: Setting font size for table data elements

7 posts were split to a new topic: Is this still Introduction to HTML?

I’m only doing these courses to refresh myself on the basics that I haven’t used in years. Heck I’m using Node.JS, React, TypeScript, Electron, and more to make cross-platform software with just Javascript, HTML, and CSS. So I’m not freaking out like most newbies. But, I came here because as a professional developer, I too noticed that it jumped straight into asking you to add font-size: 18px; inside of th, td {} and no one could possibly know that if they’ve only been doing the HTML course. I started off with the HTML introductory course and got here with no prior usage or introduction to CSS. The course should be updated to give a small explanation and a link to the css course to learn more.

You are not the first to notice this, but now that a seasoned learner has chimed in (thanks, btw) we may get some attention paid to this issue. Tagging in @alyssavigil to hand this over to the Dev Team for review. It’s been an issue for long enough to warrant some urgency.
Hint: (to team) Sometimes even the obvious is not a fall back to instruction. This is one fail that seems to have escaped many eyes. One for the annals.

Thanks for this discussion as I am a beginner at this.  If there was a previous reference in another lesson to CSS then I completely missed it.  The solution also doesn’t appear to change anything in the code for me.  If not for this thread then I would still be lost.
Once clarified/corrected I would like to do those last couple of steps again.
Thanks for the attention to this!

Glad I’m not the only one confused. Also thought it was weird it was referring to the CSS we “already did”. I think someone was editing lessons and mixed some stuff up or something.

I’m sort of in the same boat as @adriangrimroach80592 in that I’m in the process of learning to use Angular and TypeScript at work and I still don’t have a firm grasp on the basic stuff yet.  I’ve seen some stuff related to CSS before so I wasn’t as stymied as some other people in here but Codecademy definitely needs to address this.

Add me to the chorus. I have not seen anything related to CSS inn this html course. Even more confusing, is when I clicked to see the solution, I see nothing in the code that shows where the font size was changed to 18px. So I’m moving on to next lesson.

If you notice, there are tabs at the top of the black coding section.  One is labeled style.css, click on that tab.  Need to change the instructions to read, “Click on the tab labeled style.css,…”

ohhhh. I haven’t noticed the tab until your comment. Now it makes sense. Thanks! I was lost in the dark with the task “change the font size since you learned about styling earlier”.

Guys and girls,
I think i found the problem, sort of…
At the TOP of the page it says index.html AND style.css
Click on style.css – here you can easily find the 'th’and ‘td’ you have to change.
(see the hint provided by codecademy)(also, pixels is indicated as “px”)
Hope this helps!

Thanks for solving the confusion!

Thank you so much! This really helped.  I guess part of this lesson learning to look for answers 

As a complete beginner this definitely confused me with the sudden addition of CSS.  It kind of came out of nowhere and would be a little less confusing if an assumption of having no knowledge of CSS was made.

A post was merged into an existing topic: Is this still Introduction to HTML?

Thank you!  I would never have noticed the tab without your help!  

Many thanks.
I stuck here for a few minutes until I read your comment saying “add  font-size: 18px;”
Then I realize that the font size was missing so I have to add it 

THANK YOU!!! 
I was reading all messages from the top, then I found your message.

I also tried to change other font size what I have found in the “style.css” still gives me the solution.
So when I press on it, it changes to 18 that code what I ve just pasted but I can not see any other differences.
Please explain me how does it should work.

In this exercise we give multiple <div> tags an id. Can any opening <html> tag have an id attribute or can only opening <div> tags have this attribute?
Answer
Any opening <html> tag can have an id attribute. While the id attribute defines an identifier which should be unique to the whole document, it is not uncommon for several different <html> tags to have unique id attributes. To find out which attributes are available to every tag, take a look at this list of global attributes.

Do i need to use quote marks in an ID attribute?

Do we need to? Try it and see. Should we always quote attributes? Yes.

I have a question; and really appreciate your responses. As some one learns to code, are there resources/guides/books/sites that tell you how and what to do? You don’t have to memorize all these html codes, right? where do you find that information?
Also, on this website we have a little project that we type into, and it highlights our mistakes. Are there programs that do the same when you are writing HTMl? if not, is it pretty hard to go back and see your mistakes?
ALSO, 1 more question - are there search functions within html coding? some really long files could take forever to look through, right?
thanks!




 knightjmcc:

are there resources/guides/books/sites


Yes, plenty of them. Start with the documentation on w3.org. Try a search,
html elements list site:w3.org

We will do very well to study usage, permitted attributes and validation. This will lead you to UI best practices, usability and accessibility.
Top of the list for usage guidance is MDN (Mozilla Developer Network) but you will quickly add to that bookmark many other authority sites. SitePoint offers a good lot of resources to learners. Their Premium plan is affordable and opens up their massive library of reading resources.



 knightjmcc:

it highlights our mistakes


Syntax highlighting is available in all text editors that recognize HTML, CSS, etc. For beginners there is a very popular and well equipped Notepad++. When you reach the level where you are truly commited to developing, then it will be worthwhile looking into paid for IDE’s, but not until then.
You can test drive several online developer environments such as repl.it, codepen, &c. which can prove very useful since they have built in linting, which is the feature you asked about. Once you get on with your learning you may wish to look into a linter plug-in for your text editor.



 knightjmcc:

are there search functions


The common search tools usually found in the Edit menu of a text editor are more than adequate. Editors will have segment toggling to hide large sections of code to tuck it out of the way. They help to track nesting, as well. Once you discover and learn to use the many tools in your free editor, you’ll be more at home and less distracted once you move up to more professional workflow environments.
Be sure to make good use of validation. validator.w3.org

why does the solution not show the word “Introduction” on the final page?  Very confusing.

I am quite annoyed Im getting to the point where I am losing track because nothing is clearly explained

This does not appear bc it is used to organize information. The purpose as mentioned in the begining of the lesson is the “name” of an attribute and/or “value” of an attribute.

 text P-node


How many text nodes are there?

Since a text node is a node, it too has a text node, so for an element there are two text nodes. It doesn’t propagate from there. Attributes have values, which are themselves, text nodes. Add the number of these to the net total of text nodes on an element.
Nodes are objects with properties. The properties are not nodes. My bad.

So, are there four text nodes? Are you saying that a pair of opening and closing tags count as one node, and the content inside of them count as one node? So, in total (TextP-node) count as four nodes?
        
A P-node has two text nodes. That’s what I’m saying. Same applies to any HTML element. The text node has a text node.
Please share with us any search results you get from searching on this detail.

One thing for new people and others who might see this. Programming will have you cover issues that could be as small as fixing a period, a semicolon, and you name it. Coding, in general, is an act of juggling perfection and problem solving because that is what the computer understands (perfect syntax and structure along with problem-solving if done correctly). So, you, me, and anyone else will have to get used to the fact that you may be scouring a piece of program or even HTML just to fix a period or some white-space that causes an error. Which, this also includes scouring for resources and more information, and this is to say, everything isn’t perfect with Codecademy. Some things are left open-ended and are to help you build off your own curiosity, creativity, and learning abilities because the internet has plenty of resources. I am a fellow paying member so don’t mistake me for a worker; I too get frustrated with how things work with Codecademy’s site. If something like this bothers you though, then you may have to reconsider why you want to work with computers because that is what we work with at the end of the day here. Take everything and every day with a small step forward, and ask questions. If you get annoyed, then ask yourself why and analyze what’s going on. With love and respect

Question
Are line breaks the standard way of manipulating the position of HTML elements?
Answer
The answer to this is dependent on the elements you are trying to position and can become quite involved. For now, just know that in web development there is a design principle called separation of concerns. This principle guides us to keep our HTML structure distinct from its presentation.
As layout is presentational, we will generally want to use CSS to position our elements.

Line brake elements are unique in the fact that you have to use only an opening tag. Why do you have to insert a double opening tag in the exercise?

this statement is not true for html5, see this post



 coursewhiz12712:

Why do you have to insert a double opening tag in the exercise?


which exercise? Please link to exercise
inserting two break elements will create two breaks, thus more space between elements. Although the proper way would be to use <p> or <div> and use margins

to make it a paragrapgh




 michaelv.g:

to make it a paragrapgh


A paragraph has it’s own leading line-break and margin so a <br> is not essential to paragraph composition.
Line breaks need only be employed in rare instances, for convenience no less. CSS does provide for those instances as well but what’s to stop us from being stubborn or singleminded?
I use them any time text needs to appear on the next line, but then decisively so, by design. How it might be used or misused is par for the course in a declarative language environment
The point is we are the publishers and all the tools are right there. Yes, linebreaks are necessary to get us out of tight situations. but they should not be considered a part of normal page markup. The section and paragraph elements cover that.

Funny thing is the first thing I did in this exercise was substitute in the < p >< /p > tags to see if they would function the same as the double < br > since those double tags were effectively functioning as a new paragraph designation anyways.  I feel like the < br > tags in the “Learn” text section about the Nile River do a better job of presenting a functional example of where and why to use that tag.  It seems to me like more natural and structurally appropriate choice for the index.html exercise would be the < p > tag if only because it is an explicit representation of that structural element rather than the implicit representation of the < br > tag.




 hubris73:

double < br > since those double tags were effectively functioning as a new paragraph designation anyways


Wipe this delusion from your mind. As far as any user agent reading this page is concerned, only P tags denote paragraphs. BR tags are inconsequential and have ZERO meaning. They don’t even belong in proper markup, by most accounts.

So, is there is no intention for the text within the About Brown Bear heading to be separated into two paragraphs? That formatting result is just a quirk of the functional output of the tags being demonstrated in the lesson?
I can accept that, but you have to admit it makes things a bit confusing…

But it is good that you raise this point, so feel rewarded. We will get to the bottom of this.

<br> has a way of influencing inline content to behave  like block level by inducing a linebreak, which is a block level activity. It pretends the line above has run out of space and wrapping is forced. We all know this to not be the case, so we were duped.
As CSS gained traction we (the community) devised ways to utilize the <span> element to fill in this role by making it a block level object within a P and not interrupt the flow. The question has come up in the forums, “What use the SPAN element?” Well, here’s one.

Margins?.. Could you please explain how margins can be used.

Margins are taught in the css course, can highly recommend the css course
here is a simple example:
https://jsbin.com/recivajede/edit?html,css,output
where i use margins to push world down.

Line breaks are from along time ago before CSS was around. When you wanted to put some white space in-between any 2 blocks of text you inserted line breaks. It functions just like using the return/enter key/lever on a keyboard/typewriter is my best understanding of the reason and use of the <br> tag.

Does this mean that there really is no difference between using <br> and <p></p>?
Thank you.

breaks and paragraphs are very different. Break elements are a quick and dirty hack while paragraph are proper block elements with margin

22,"<div> and <p> elements seem to do the same thing, what are the differences between the two?","FAQ,HTML FAQ",q-a,14,"
Question
I notice I can use either div or p elements in the workspace and the paragraphs seems to display exactly the same. Since it doesn’t seem to matter much one way or another, which element should I use here and why?
Answer
This is a great discovery as it illustrates that div and p elements have something in common: they are both block level elements. As such, the browser renders these elements in the same way. It is up to the developer to pick the tag which best describes the content it will contain. When we are dealing with paragraphs, the semantically correct tag to pick would be the p tag.
As you press on with your learning, keep on experimenting in the workspace!
","
i thought that p element be the bet to implement on a webpage as compared to div element.

I am contain p elements in div & feel good

The elements are ‘semantic’ that means they describe the content between the open and close tags. The p element is paragraph level content, usually text. The div describes a section of a portion of the page or content. Divs usually contain different kinds of content that is all related to a single thing, like an image and an article about it. There is also an ‘article’ tag and a few others that help browsers and, most importantly, search engines find specific content on your web pages.




 rubyslayer42889:

It is up to the developer to pick the tag which best describes the content it will contain


it is up to the developer`s GOALS about the relevance of the site to search engines, I think. If we write the content in an “artistic” way, we may be understood by nobody…

I believe the OP has pointed out the relational similarities between the two tags.  Semantically correct is another way of saying most academically supported (i.e. - W3C schools, and other HTML standards resources).  Differentiating between the two will not be critical until other tools that are very container driven, like Bootstrap 4, are applied.  There will be many more  tags that will need to be carefully nested to ensure proper reactivity in certain device displays.

Sorry for unclear question… Should the ‘b’ of “brown bears” be directly underneath the ‘<’ of the ‘p’ tag on the line above? Thanks

It should be after the <p>

I don’t get it.  Could u explain a bit simpler?  (me = beginner , me no understand)

hello, please what do you mean by “artistic way” ?

Actually there is a difference between the two, the p tag inserts a new paragraph, for example if you want to put a little space between two consecutive images or videos, whereas the div tag doesn’t have that power.

Experiment and talk in other forums. Google. As far as I’ve seen it’s more used p than div but will depend on the context.

23,What does it mean for a tag to be rendered?,"FAQ,HTML FAQ",q-a,5,"
Question
This exercise says that tags will be rendered. What does it mean for a tag to be rendered?
Answer
A key component of a web browser is its rendering engine. The rendering engine takes HTML code and renders it or interprets it into what we see visually on the page. A tag like <em> together with the browser’s default style sheet, instructs the rendering engine to display this tag’s content in italics, thereby emphasizing its content.
","
That was very interesting. Thanks for that.

So can we change how to browser interprets a tag like  with our own CSS or are certain tags defaulted by the browser always (like h1, h2; em and strong etc)?

Every browser has default interpretations for tags, yes. As mentioned in the lesson, content in  tags will usually display as italicized text and content in  tags will display as bolded text. However, the browser is programmed to look first for any CSS instructions in (or linked to) the document it is rendering. If the CSS instructions say to display text marked up with  tags with pink underlines, or h1 headings as half the font size of regular paragraph text, that’s what the browser will do.

Question
Can the content of the <title> element be the same as the content of the <h1> element?
Answer
Yes. While the content may be the same, it doesn’t have to be. The content of the <title> element is metadata about the page. It is displayed within a window tab and is used for page indexing. On the other hand, the content of the <h1> element is used to create a heading hierarchy. <h1> content is usually very prominently displayed on the site itself.

Yeah, It could be but the main diiference is that metadata of  couldnt display on the page while  main heading display on the page

what is page indexing ?

Indexing is crawling data by search engines from your webpage and storing it into search engines databases. For SEO optimization, it is good that each of your page has a in  tag relevant content.

How can I make a good indexing, how to choose the correct words or structure the data in the best way?

There are well over 200 factors that come into play when measuring the relevancy and quality of a webpage. It’s not something that can covered in a single answer. How many signals does the page contain that indicate the same topic or idea? How explicit is the title in relation to the content of the page? How easy is it to discover the outline of the page? Is the page free of grammatical and spelling errors? Is the meaning relatively simple to disseminate? Does the HTML validate? Is the page accessible? Is it mobile friendly?
Some people believe that as long as you have lots of inbound links then it’s a sign the page is popular and will receive a higher page rank. It is not as simple as all that. How many competing sites is yours up against? How many keywords can you compete with? What’s the bounce rate of your page?
This is not a simple discussion. Start reading now and in a year’s time you might be half way to being prepared.

that was a perfect answer but leads to other questions ,
can you please suggest what can we read in order to improve the page index ?
thank you !

This one will be a good start…

https://moz.com/beginners-guide-to-seo


It is also convenient for SEO to differentiate the titles and H1 to give different and relevant information to bots about the whole site and each page.

If the TITLE and H1 elements match, or nearly match, search engines have a easier time choosing the description to use in the SERPs for that page.
It would make no sense to have a TITLE, Oranges and an H1, Apples

What happens if we put raw text directly in the <ul> element?
Answer
Browsers are designed to be very lenient and highly error tolerant so in this case the text would display on the page. However, it would not be displayed as a list and this is not best practice as it defies the HTML5 specification.

No. Unlike the global id attribute, the src attribute can only be applied to specific tags of which the p tag is not included. In other words, not all attributes are available to every tag. To find out which attributes are available to every tag, take a look at this list of global attributes.
","

There is no link between the two. All HTML is raw text. src is an attribute that takes a URI as a value. Only a handful of elements have this attribute.

As for populating P elements from an external source, that would have to be done in the DOM using AJAX, which will come up later in the course. For now, be content to write all content directly to the HTML document raw source.

27,Doesn't CSS define presentation of web content?,"FAQ,HTML FAQ",q-a,14,"
Question
Codecademy says that a markup language like HTML “defines structure and presentation of raw text”. Doesn’t CSS define the presentation of web content?
Answer
That is correct! These days HTML is best categorized as a descriptive markup language which encourages developers to focus on the semantic meaning of information rather than its visual appearance. However, there are other markup languages which make no such separation of concerns. In fact, HTML used to be more presentational before the advent of CSS.
On a related note, it is important to realize that most browsers have default styles which they will apply to certain HTML elements.
","
So, for clarity, as a layman…What the ■■■■ does that mean?

In its simplest terms. HTML is your skeleton with text, images, links etc forming a base/foundation of a webpage and CSS is your muscles, skin and clothing to make it more presentable with font style, font colours, image alignment, background colours etc.
If you want another example, if you build a house, the brickwork, plastering and foundations are HTML, the CSS is your external and interior decorating to jazz it up abit.
HTML can be used exclusively when designing a webpage, but you’re rather limited as to what you can tweak visually on a webpage. CSS released a few years after HTML had been out so until it was released a developer had to make do with the tools at their disposal. There can, in some instances, be blurred lines between the two langauges but it’s often encourged to use HTML as a foundation and CSS as your style.
There are other markup languages which I’m not going to go into, that can do both raw text and styling at the same time, but this can look messy and is not very beginner friendly which is why HTML and CSS are seen as the standard for starting out.
I hope this eases any confusion @bitplayer07282

So is HTML a place to store content and CSS is a how we make that content more presentable.

@rgurule Yes, although I wouldn’t say HTML is a “place” or use the word “store” because the storing is done elsewhere. I think just saying HTML is a way to write content while CSS is a way to format that content is more appropriate.

You mean “…rather than its visual appearance” - its in this case should not have an apostrophe. It’s with an apostrophe is reserved for the “it + is” conjunction. Its (no apostrophe) is the possessive of it, as in “its visual appearance”.

So HTML is the skeleton, CSS is skin and muscles, what’s PHP in this illustration?
Thanks

Hi @Gal3rm,
Are you familiar with what PHP is? I’m going to proceed with my answer under the assumption that it is a rudimentary knowledge so I can give the most simple answer possible.
HTML is a in the category of whats referred to as “front end technology” in terms of web development. I’m not going to go too far into this as sometimes the line can get blurred but whats important here is front end refers to what the user will see, so, referring back to my analogy, this would be the human form (HTML Skeleton with CSS skin and muscles)
PHP is slightly special in that it is a server side scripting language. With it being server side, this means the scripts will run in the “back end” of the website, or, put bluntly, everything the user doesn’t see. When PHP scripts execute they will manipulate data which is on the server and change output based on what a user will input. I suppose the most apt comparison within my analogy would be to compare it to a human brain. I could compare it to movement within the muscles but that would primarily be animation, it’s the brain that sends the instruction to the muscles to tell them how to react. PHP is what would make a website more dynamic, often pulling information from a database that would also be part of the back end.
I hope this helps =)

28,Is there a way to have the list items sit flush against the page like the rest of the text?,"FAQ,HTML FAQ",q-a,3,"
Question
The list items we created are indented relative to the rest of the text on this page. Is there a way to have the list items sit flush against the page like the rest of the text?
Answer
Indeed there is a way! Most browsers use a default style sheet to apply some padding to the left of the <ul> and <ol> elements. Developers can overwrite this default padding by creating their own custom CSS style sheets.
","
Hi! I posted this on the other thread, but instead of using padding, couldn’t we just put the LI tag on its own without being nested in the UL parent tag? I played around with the code and previews in the Elements and Structure exercise in the Introduction to HTML lectures and figured that UL means that a list is coming up and indents the succeeding text, while LI makes a bullet point for the text. By this, if you were to create an unordered list that you wanted sitting flush with the rest of the text rather than indented, you can make a list with the LI tags, and omit the UL tag, it seems? What would go wrong if we didn’t nest it in a UL tag if we simply didn’t want it indented then?
Thank you!

I also posted this comment in another response here: Does the <li> tag always have to be nested within the <ul> tag?

Browsers are designed to be very lenient and highly error-tolerant so in this case, the text would display on the page. This can be rendered sometimes, sometimes not. So, it’s the best practice if you use ul or ol before using li.

30,Why would we want to “section off” tables with the `<tbody>` tag?,"FAQ,HTML FAQ",q-a,11,"
Question
Why would we want to “section off” tables with the <tbody> tag?
Answer
The <tbody> tag together with the <thead> and <tfoot>tags (which you will learn about in the next two exercise) give our tables semantic meaning. These tags stand to improve the user experience in a number of ways:

enhanced screen reading experience for the visually impaired

<thead> and <tfoot> information can be shown on each page for printing
with a bit of CSS, <thead> and <tfoot> information can be seen while scrolling through long tables.

","
 and  already makes the code easy to read but is it still a common practice to include a comment such as  to improve easy readability?

Comments are an awesome practice as well.
The  <tbody>, <thead>, and <tfoot> tags are mainly only there to help you, the developer. Using these tags, you can easily style the header or footer differently than the actual content of the table without having to create classes for them.
For example:
thead, tfoot {
  font-weight: bold;
  background-color: #005
}

The above code would give the header and the footer of all tables a dark-blue background color and bold text. This helps the user to easily distinguish the header from the content.




 upsideumop:

`` tags are mainly only there to help you, the developer.


The developer doesn’t come into mind; the user agent is what these are aimed at.
When it knows about their existence, it can sort things out for itself, usually regardless what order we write them. The UA knows that a header comes before a body which comes before a footer. All we as developers are doing is telling the UA that these are the component parts of our table broken down into three sections.
And let’s not forget the <caption></caption> which accessiblity guidelines recommnend.

Good point. I was referring to the fact that they make it easier to style the page. Sorry I communicated that poorly.




 upsideumop:

Sorry I communicated that poorly.


I do it all the time; and, rarely apologize. Neither do you need to. Every moment a learning experience. Take from it what you may. Cheers!

Shouldn’t it be “two exercises”?

Yeah it should be “two exercises”.

  :grinnin​:grinning:

Where should we put the tbody element? 

A TABLE element has four direct child sectioning elements:

caption
thead
tbody
tfoot

Under accessibility guidelines, CAPTION is required, and should be just inside the TABLE element, followed by the other three in that order. THEAD contains header information such as table title and column headings. TBODY contains the table rows and table data. TFOOT contains the boilerplate and small print such as appendix and other footnote details.

31,How can I store my own images online?,"FAQ,HTML FAQ",q-a,13,"
Question
How can I store my own images online so that I can link to their urls within my own websites?
Answer
There are sites that allow you to upload your images to the web. Once your image is uploaded, you can then use its web address as the value for the <img> element’s src attribute. More commonly, images and project assets are stored within a folder that also contains our HTML document. This allows developers to create paths to be used as src values that are relative to the HTML document. In other words, images and HTML files often exist on the same server or computer.

2 posts were split to a new topic: Use a file path from your personal computer to upload an image

6 posts were split to a new topic: Do i need to always have my personal computer active



Are there any advantages in uploading images in one’s own site? Or is it just a waste of space because you can just upload it somewhere else and then insert the link of the image in one’s site?

The advantage would be that you have better control over the images if they are on your own server (or stored in your own hosting account). If you wish to keep images from being indexed by search engines then this would be where to start.
The downside is that your pages may load slower if the images are large files. Most servers only allow two connections at any one time. The more images in the page, the longer the download process will take.
There are ways we can optimize images so they load quickly among which are using fixed sizes to match the width and height attributes and save the files as optimized for the web. A 400 X 300 JPEG can be optimized to as low as 32kb (or lower) at a reasonable quality level (compression) so that they take virtually no time to transfer; or, using a single image comprised of all the images much like a contact sheet a photographer would create. Using CSS the images can be located in the sheet, also known as a sprite.
CDNs (Content Distribution Network) are useful for a couple of reasons…

they have several hundred (or thousand) servers, all storing the same content but situated in various high traffic regions of the world;
they offer more consecutive connections than the two allowed on the host server so more downloads can take place in background.


Will images be indexed by search engines through reading their alternative text? If so, why not just have the text somewhere else and save storage?
If large images load slower, what about using SVG (vector) images?




 kutada:

through reading thier alternative text?


Not as a direct result, no. It’s their IMG tag and SRC attribute that the robots crawl for. The alternate text comes into play when the search engine is determining where to insert the image into the index (as in which index to add them to).
Consider,

A search robot discovers a link to your site.
The robot requests the resource.
The robot’s boss, the search server quickly parses the document and creates a list of href and src attribute values.
The list above gets compared to the index and rankings of the target sites are recalculated’.

The next step is to continue crawling your site. Search engines know to look for specific pages and folders.
Home
About
Contact
Products
Services
etc.

and,
images
videos
audio
media
etc.

If there are no robot restrictions and those folders are searchable, the SE will add every file to the ‘src’ list that it already has. We can protect folders, but that is for another discussion. Just know that search engines will go anywhere we do not restrict them from going. A web server is a search robot’s playground. Like JS, they are determined to get the job done by whatever means.

What’s the image tag?

I know this is 24 days late so you probably have the answer, but I was confused as well and this lesson seems to be useful and timeless. It seems the  doesnt require a closing tag for the same reason  doesn’t, as it’s just placing the box/picture there.

<input> is among those few that we call void elements, named so because they do not enclose content in a wrapper the way <p></p> and all the other content sectioning tags do.
Self-closing tags contain their data in attributes which are properties of that element object. The value attribute takes all the user input from the keyboard and on Submit, packages it with the name given in the name attribute for that content.

Hello, Im new in this and I have a question. Why does the  element hasn’t a closing tag?
Thank you.

Hi 
In normal HTML elements, we put content between the start and end tag. But in case of some elements, it does not make sense for them to have any content. For example, let’s take a look at <br> element - this element produces a line break… and that’s it. It’s really hard to imagine how content inside the line break could be rendered, right? 
Another example - <hr> element - this element represents a paragraph-level thematic break which is usually visually represented in the form of a horizontal line (like the one below this paragraph). And again, it simply does not make any sense for this element to have any content.

And the same goes for <input> element. What could be the content of this element? Ok, it got value, but the value is based on the input from the user so it belongs to the attribute, it’s not really content.
In HTML5 elements that can’t have any content are known as Void elements, there are only a few void elements: area, base, br, col, embed, hr, img, input, link, meta, param, source, track, wbr.
Void elements only have a start tag; end tags must not be specified for void elements. Sometimes you can find code that looks like this:
<input type=""text"" value=""hello"" name=""hello"" />

The /> is sometimes referred to as a self-closing tag, but this is incorrect. / does not mean anything in HTML5 (except for foreign elements, which are rather uncommon) and does not change anything, it can be omitted.




 factoradic:

/ does not mean anything in HTML5


Would this not also apply to HTML5 served as XML? It must conform to XHTML, as I understand it, though in HTML5 the space preceding the slash is optional.

In XHTML there are self-closing tags, no void elements (different mechanics). So the / or a full end tag (<br/> will be treated as <br></br>) would be necesarry in XHTML. So to maintain compatibility with XHTML you would have to use /.
But today there are not really many reasons to care for compatibility with XHTML. There are many differences between XHTML and HTML5 (for example named character references, attributes without values), trying to provide compatibility when you don’t really need it is just a waste of time.

I strongly advocate to not call void elements self-closing. In my opinion, this makes it a lot easier to understand what is going on when we use foreign elements (that might be truly self-closing) - for example from the SVG namespace. It would be so confusing to say:


img is a self-closing element, you can add /, but it is not required, you cannot add </img> tag

circle in SVG namespace is a self-closing element, you have to add / or </circle> tag



Thanks for the highlight of the /> closing slash as not required. Answered my question.

Very well explained…

absolutely true, soft tabs vs hard tabs. Soft tabs (the tab key insert spaces) seems favorable, which make sense given it works better when different developers on the same project use there own preferred editor.

tabs are easier

perdon por la pregunta pero alguien me podria brindar el codigo para insertar una pestaña?
o me lo copia y pega aqui

press the tab key on your keyboard?

is an 1 tab equal to 2 spaces?

that depends on your editor settings, you can configure/tweak that.

I’m having a real hard time here. WHERE exactly am I supposed to be indenting? Inbetween each word or??? I caved and had it solve it itself but I still have no grasp whatsoever on what I’m supposed to be doing to indent.

when an element is nested inside another element. To make it easier to read, so that when you’re looking at the elements, you can get a rough idea of how far the element is in the parent > child hierarchy.

An additional question from a 1st week user, please forgive my ignorance.  When using a text editor/IDE (hopefully I am using the correct terminology) I’ve found if I want to indent multiple lines of code by highlighting, I can only successfully accomplish this by pressing the tab key.  When I do so, all of the highlighted lines of code will be indented by one tab value.  When I try to indent via the space bar (2 spaces), the highlighted text is deleted.  If the better practice for indentation is 2 spaces rather than the tab key, how does one indent multiple lines of code while adhering to said practice? Thank you in advance.

selecting text and started typing (space or any letter) will replace the selection. That is pretty standard. Same behavior as here on the forum or in a word document.
so we can indent using tab. But there are two kind of tabs: soft tab and hard tab.
soft tabs means the tab key insert spaces. While hard tabs insert a special tab character. Most text-editors/IDE’s should have a setting for soft tab. Just make sure soft tab is enabled, and you can use the tab key to insert spaces
soft tab might also be the default, just verify it in the settings in that case
shift + tab is also useful, you can un-indent your code.

Thank you. Much appreciated

One thing to say is that text editors are NOT IDE’s. Search on Google the differences between these two. While modern text editors can have integrated IDE’s in or IDE’s can contain text editor’s, they are different things.

Well I do use the tab bc is easier for me and I see it in some way more objective than two spaces as I usually use spaces to delimeter the words in my code (human text). I still think that 1 tab is equal to 2 spaces so I don’t see the problem there. I’m going to stick with the tabs unless someone convinces me not to do so.

I do understand the point of so much of discussion about the tab and space.
Why cannot the tab just be standardized to three spaces everywhere?

Is it considered proper , or even allowed, to also include one blank line, White Space, between elements in order to make the code more readable in the event some other person may need to read and/or edit the code?

If the code is not cluttered with a inline style attributes or excessive use of class and id then a single line break is perfectly acceptable, perhaps even encouraged. Too much white space can negatively affect readability.
A blank line between distinct sections is not a bad idea, though. That can be helpful to spot page segments.

Now one feels the perfect fool… linebreaks vs indentation. How the heck was I blinded by that?
Two space indentation is very likely preferred over four space or tabs owing that there is so much nesting in HTML. The browser cares not what we use, so it’s strictly readability we’re concerned with.
Indentation is not decoration. We use it to convey nesting to the reader. HTML is declarative and parental. Nested elements are children at every level of nesting to which they belong. This manner of writing the HTML helps in tracking these relationships.

You’re super helpful you’re everywhere I read. =) Thank you.

where is the option to like this answer ??

So this is probably a dumb question, but do I need to use 2 indenations for div under body or does it go on the same level? I’m still not clear on lesson 6 are div and body  relatives or is body parent to div? It just says that div is an element. Cause it seemed like div is used to induce more structure concerning readabilty and the code run correctly whether I’ve put it on the same level as body or intended it (I’ve intented the lines under it then , more precisely in this exercise h2  and h3 ). But my logic kinda dicates that it makes difference in structure and groupation if I indent it under body or no. Maybe I’m completely off on this, but I could use clarification concering relations between div and body. Thank you 

As far as indentation of HTML is concerned, it is not a requirement. No indentation is just as valid, assuming the document is well formed.

The above is perfectly valid markup. What relationship does each element have to the BODY? In general, they are all descendants.
DIV is the only direct child. SECTION is a grandchild of BODY, and a direct child of DIV.
H1, P, and UL are direct children of SECTION, grandchildren of DIV, and great-grandchildren of BODY. Together they are siblings.
LI is a direct child of UL. All the LIs are sibling elements.
In the second SECTION, H1, P and FIGURE are direct children of SECTION. IMG and FIGCAPTION are sibling children of FIGURE.
Indentation helps us to identify descendants, often referred to by level.
<body>
  <div>
    <section>
      <h1>heading</h1>
      <p>paragraph</p>

This was extremely helpful, thank you very much 

seem not to understand “Remember to always add two spaces of indentation when you nest elements inside of s for better readability.” I’ll appreciate if anyone can explain this with example…thanks.

Hello and welcome 
Indentation means spacing. Usually, indentation is very important in coding, most codes won’t run if the indentation is not correct. In HTML this is not the case, the code will run correctly whether you put spacing or no. BUT… “for better readability” means you should use indentation since the code then literally is easier to read and if anyone else came across your code, you would make life much easier for them. Why? Because in HTML all elements we use are like a family tree (body is parent to div, div is parent to section, section is parent to heading and paragraph etc.) so we use indentation to express these relationships. For example:
<body>
  <div id=""intro"">
    <h1>Introduction to HTML</h1>
    <p>Since relationships between elements are represented in spacing, if two elements are on the same level, they are considered siblings. In this example I tried to arrange them properly so you can see the parent is body element, his first and only kid is div element (has two spaces of indentation) while h1 and p elements are siblings, ergo, are on the same level of indentation (or have the same spacing) and are located right under each other but since they are kids to div element, we had to use two spaces on them to accentuate this</p> 
  </div>
</body>

Hope this helps a bit  you can refer to my question above, mtf user explained it great for me too.
Good luck!

Why doesn’t the online code editor automatically indent things that are put in the div tags? I put in the div tags, but had to manually indent the items between the tags Thanks!

36,Why does the browser need metadata about the page?,"FAQ,HTML FAQ",,8,"
Question
Why does the browser need metadata about the page?
Answer
There exists different categorizations of metadata but most generally metadata is “data about data”. While the browser doesn’t need most metadata it does often use metadata to enhance the user experience in some way. Metadata not displayed on a page but behind the scenes it can be used by other software (web crawlers, search engines, browsers,  etc.) to process, encode, extract or index all sorts of interesting information (geographic coordinates, calendar events, contact info, etc.). What’s more, businesses are often interested in using metadata to improve SEO or Search Engine Optimization.
","
Does it make a difference whether metadata come before  or after it?

HTML is read by the browser from the top of the document to bottom of the document. Important data (language, characters, frameworks, etc.) is stored in the  section and should be as close to the top of the document as possible so the browser knows how the page should be displayed.

I just started to learn about HDML, it is very interesting stuff to learn. This is going to take a long time to learn, from what I can see is going on, there is a lot of cross references to learn. For example, after I learn about the elements reference, they are input, link, too  many to mentions here.

try bookmarking all the references. I know it feels really overwhelming! I found that putting everything in a smart bookmarking list can help a lot! and take your time learning and reading those things you bookmarked 

Meta tags allow the browser to display the HTML page correctly, and for search robots to correctly index and rank sites. Thus, using meta tags, webmaster reports metadata (that is, additional data that is not visible to the user) about each specific page of the site. That is why the use of meta tags for the site is so necessary. This data is only needed by crawlers https://sitechecker.pro/website-crawler/ of  search engines. Users do not see them. They contain additional information that allows for automatic processing and systematization of the page in the general flow of information on the Internet.

Is there a limit on the amount of metadata you should put inside the  element?
Do some developers input metadata that’s unrelated to the web content to improve SEO?

no, attributes are not order specific.

Is it mandatory that the target attribute be written after the href attribute or it doesn’t matter, it functions the same either way?

I’m pretty sure that you don’t have to include the target attribute, it’s just good practice to make determinations about how the browser will open a link you insert. If you don’t specify it, I’m sure browsers have some kind of default link-opening behavior.

It is not mandatory, but like the article stated that you may want the person to come back to your page. Without the target attribute the link will open the new page in your same tab. If the person closes the tab they also close your page. Opening it in a new tab will make sure they come back to your page after they close out the other tab.

What are the advantages of using relative paths?
Aren’t absolute paths more secure? For example if I would move my internal html file accidentally into another folder, the relative path would be incorrect and thus the link dead.
Or would the internal moving change the absolute path as well; so that the absolute path relies 100% on the relative path?
","
examples of absolute path:
# windows
c:\users\username\pictures\img1.jpg
# *nix
/home/username/pictures/img1.jpg

if then then move the image from pictures to documents, the absolute path would also break.
relative paths are better, given we can then move the entire project to a different computer (which very likely has a different username) and we don’t have to go and find all the absolute paths with the username in it

For some reason, this answer made it very clear to me in a general way the differences and uses of the different types of paths. Thank you @stetim94.

Relative paths are also advantageous if one moves entire website from one domain to a different domain altogether. You do not have to change all local links. For example, imagine a file like www.example.com/images/picture1.jpg. If we realise we want to change our domain to www.site.com because of any other reasons but we want to leave the files intact, the picture1.jpg image will break. But if it is a relative file like /images/picture1.jpg it will still work. So relative links are advantageous when changing domains

40,How do we know which heading element to pick?,"FAQ,HTML FAQ",q-a,25,"
Question
How do we know which heading element to pick? For example, why did we use <h1> tags for “The Brown Bear” title but <h3> tags for “Features” in this exercise?
Answer
Heading elements should be chosen in a way that reflects how the content of our page should be organized. Later in this lesson, you will use the div element to divide this page into various sections. Each of those sections will have a title contained within the <h2> tags and various subtitles which are contained within the <h3> tags.
As “The Brown Bear” title is the main heading for this document, we use the <h1> tags here. As “Features” is a subtitle to the “About Brown Bears” section of the page (which will eventually be more clearly delineated with div elements) we use <h3> tags to contain this heading.
To learn more about headings and how they should be used to organize information, take a look at this tutorial.
","
Hi there,
I’m a Web Accessibility Coordinator and content strategist. Regarding when to use which heading tag, the h1 tag is reserved for the headline of the page, the main topic, not to be confused with the page title. The next section of content on the page should be an h2 tag. If there’s a subset of information under that section, give the section a header using the h3 tag. If there’s a subset of information under the h3 heading, give that an h4 tag and so on in chronological order.
From a Web accessibility point of view, there should be only one h1 tag per page because this is the topic of the page, and there should be only one topic per page, like a Wikipedia article. There are usually multiple h2 tags per page.
Also, the heading tags should go in chronological order. If you want your websites to be accessible for assistive technology devices (such as screen readers), the headings cannot skip. If you want to adjust the sizes of the headings (which I often do), that can be done without sacrificing the chronological order of the headings.
So a page’s structure could look like this:
<body>

<title></title>

<h1></h1>

<h2></h2>

<h3></h3>

<h4></h4>

<h5></h5>

<h6></h6>

Nakitanaidu,
CodeCademy is very sensitive as to what you write in the box.
You wrote “Countries with Small Brown Bear Populations.”, but you put a period. Delete the period, and i THINK you should be good.

For example you can observe any popular websites’ underlying code(be pressing f12 on firefox browser). I looked at wikipedia and their main heading is h1 tag and the following ones are h2 tags. Hope this helps in practical aspect.

To be honest, i was stuck here as well and had to have the site, give me the solution. In your instruction, you ask to put the period in the code but now you say to remove it. I cant afford to sit here for 20 minutes trying to figure out what i didn’t wrong when ive done nothing wrong. Why haven’t they resolved this?

It’s similar to writing a paper for school. Have you written an essay using Microsoft Word before? Did you know you can assign H1, H2, H3 heading formats to different sections? This is how your table of contents is built in a Microsoft Word Doc. It knows to look for those headings and categorize them accordingly on a table of contents. For example, “Chapter 1” would be a H1 and a subsection would be an H2.
Think of your webpage in the same way. The way you assign H1, h2, H3 will be how you will want to make your references once you start using CSS more.

on line 8 when I write code, it does not pass.
I get an error like this:
Did you create an `` header that contains `Countries with Small Brown Bear Populations` ?
        
@1minuteholidays74038 Remove the period from that line:



 1minuteholidays74038:

Countries with Small Brown Bear Populations. <—



I was a bit confused with this exercise, I thought I should put h4 after the Features but the instruction said h2 so I just went on with it and got it right but in my head, I was asking the same question.


this is what it should look like.

Guys i cant seem to proceed from this headings lesson, despite doing the exercise. below is how my work looks like.

codecademy is quite weird for how they choose to put the text in order, on one time it wanted me to add a paragraph into a div which 1 was right the other was wrong however gave me the same end result… so i re-wrote the code completely and worked, so just keep it simple and just focus on the end result

Hey @tag8477078017, welcome to the forums!
Codecademy is case-sensitive/punctuation in this exercise and so you have to make sure that you included all the periods and small things like that. This might have been why you had trouble the first time through, but were easily able to pass the second time.

Thanks for the information!

its vital to check for spelling errors to get these facts right. I got stucked several times before i got it finally right

Thanks 4 the Suggestions 

I know this is an old forum to throw an answer in here this later, but one thing for new people and others who might see this. Programming will have you cover issues that could be as small as fixing a period, a semicolon, and you name it. Coding, in general, is an act of juggling perfection and problem solving because that is what the computer understands (perfect syntax and structure along with problem-solving if done correctly). So, you, me, and anyone else will have to get used to the fact that you may be scouring a piece of program or even HTML just to fix a period or some white-space that causes an error. If something like this bothers you, then you may have to reconsider why you want to work with computers because that is what we work with at the end of the day here. With love and respect

Question
Why is the doctype a different color from the  tags?
Answer
Line one is not actually an HTML element or tag. As you discovered in the first    exercise of this lesson,  it  is a declaration that lets the browser know that it is looking at an HTML5 document and it should be parsed  accordingly.
Text editors like the one you are using in this workspace often use different colors to help developers distinguish between different pieces of code and to aid in overall readability.

This exercise says, “A URL is the web address or local address where a file is stored”. What is a local address and how does it differ from a web address?
Answer
A local address refers to the path to an image, file, or resource that exists on your own computer. A web address on the other hand generally refers to the path to an image, file, or resource that exists externally, on a remote computer.

Thx a lot! Ur answer really helps! 

Hi! Since you mentioned that a local address refers to the path that the file exists on our computer, by path - do you mean the file location? And in that case, if we move around or edit the file in our computer (say, put it in a different folder, rename the file name, etc), since the path would be different, would that prevent the image from loading or properly rendering?
Thank you so much!

43,What type of content might an HTML element contain?,"FAQ,HTML FAQ",q-a,8,"
Question
The element in this exercise contains text but can elements contain other types of content? If so, what types of content might an HTML element contain?
Answer
It depends on the element. As you will learn, <p>, <div>, and <span> elements can contain text whereas elements like <ul> or <ol> should only contain <li> elements as direct children.
Block level tags like the <div> can contain all tags that can exist within the <body> (in other words, we can nest other elements within a <div>) whereas self-closing tags like <img> can not contain any content at all!

Use Markdown,BBCcode or HTML format

Where can I find a list of html tags that helps explain what kind of content they can contain?

The most common types of content that HTML elements contain are text, images, and video.

What about this case here : <div><p>hello world</p></div>
can i say that the <p> tag and the text (the paragraph element) is the content of the <div> element, or just the text “hello world” is the content or just the paragraph tag is the content?
I need to understand this exemple to understand the whole lesson.
thanks

Content is everything that we download to the requesting client. As for what elements may contain (including permitted attributes) is defined in the W3C recommendations.  w3.org
What is most important is that we use markup to structure the document, not to present it.



 quourtige:

can i say that the <p> tag and the text (the paragraph element) is the content of the <div> element, or just the text “hello world” is the content or just the paragraph tag is the content?


Given the generic nature of content we use some tags for structure, and some for semantics. Our HTML if well formed will be easily readable in raw form. There is meaning in structure, both to a reader of the source, and to search engines. Where structure alone doesn’t provide enough information to the user agent we resort to semantic elements to convey meaning.
The user is getting meaning from the content; the user agent is deriving meaning from the structure and semantic elements. It’s important to draw this distinction. We’re not talking about one kind of meaning, but two.
From the interpretation of our structure we derive the behavior of the document, which again drives the APIs. Using style sheets and script we can enhance those behaviors, or make them more readily visible (accessible) to the user. This takes us into the presentation, which is not part of the above discussion.
I often suggest to learners that they should not embark upon the study of CSS and script (JavaScript, ECMAScript, ES(n)) until well aquainted with HTML in its detail. The HTML is the root document from which the DOM is constructed. Understand the HTML side of the DOM and the rest will fall into place in short order with no confusion. Skip this step and expect trouble in the other two. That’s a promise.
Now given that the DOM is a tree, in its most general form, we have a root element, the <html></html> indicated by <!DOCTYPE html>, and all others fall into  that as child elements.
<div>
  <p>Hello World!</p>
</div>

In the above, DIV is the parent element. Its content, or child element is the P. Collectively they are a part of the content of the page, not separately or distinctly. The only thing distinct is the message we publish to the user.
Given we have by the point of the above a well formed document, we will have a root element, a direct child element, the BODY, and it will contain the above. HTML is a parent, and all elements that follow are children. BODY is a direct child of HTML, and only one of a handful that are allowed. Everything the user sees will be contained in the body of the document. That is the content.
So now we can construct the tree.
html
* head
* body
    + div
        + p
            + text node
        + text node
    + text node

The root of the tree is html, the trunk, body. DIV is a branch node, and P a leaf node off that, with the text being the surface of the leaf. Note that the user sees the leaves of the tree.
Bottom line, spend as much time as it takes to track down and study the specifications and recommendations, and a little history thrown in and study of earlier releases. One cannot stress enough how important it is that you not only become fluent with HTML, but fluent at delving deep into the W3C specifications. Look up every new element you learn about… The same day, preferably. You’ll find links to most in the MDN pages, for a simpler approach.
Cement this stuff into your brain. Seriously. This will give you all the legs you need to stand on once you embark on CSS and script.

thank you very much for your detailed answer,i think i understand.
so, the content is what users get mening from it such as texts,images it is like you said the surface of the leaf, thus for the user the surface of the leaf is the content (the thing that he can derive the meaning from it). in this lesson we mean this type of content
as for user agent, the content is the structure and the semantic elements that it can derive the meaning from it.
also, i can understand that HTML is like a tree with HTML is the root and head and body element are direct children of the html element and the body and head are siblings (they will be in the same line in the tree) and like that.
thanks for your advice i will follow by it.

44,Can we use an alt attribute with the video tag?,"FAQ,HTML FAQ",q-a,22,"
Question
The text content of video tags seems to behave in the same way as the alternative text for the img tag. For consistency, can we use an alt attribute with the video tag instead?
Answer
This is a great observation but we can not use the alt attribute within the opening video tag. While this may seem inconsistent, this is actually by design as we might want our video element to contain some fallback options. For example, if the video doesn’t load we might want to display a link to another video that does. As attributes can not contain markup, this scenario would not be possible with alt attributes alone.
If this fallback handling gives the developer more control, you might be wondering why the img tag doesn’t follow suit. The answer to this involves backwards-compatibility troubles.

Attributes may not contain HTML mark up (tags), only printable characters.



 arcsolver75719:

The number one trouble would be a browser that does not support HTML5, which is when the VIDEO element was introduced. For a less generalized point of view, study the documentation and other articles relating to this element.

We do have an alternative to alt (alternate text) that works across all browsers, the title attribute is valid on the VIDEO element.
<video title=""Bruce Lee meets Jackie Chan"" ...>

but we can still give the external link under alt (alternate text) even though if it can’t contain markup.

We do have an alternative to alt (alternate text) that works across all browsers, the title attribute is validr on the VIDEO element.
since i just checked screen readers are not able to  read the content using title attribute unlike alt

Screen readers can be set to verbose on title attributes, but usually default to alternate text only so the user isn’t inundated with chatter. title attributes are global, and apply to other elements such as links, language change, page fragments, etc. It’s for this reason they are not turned on by default.

the alt attribute contains only text, so how is it not possible to include that? it shouldnt contain “tags” you say. what can happen if i write, say, < video src= “xyz” controls alt =“video on so-and-so”  > and close the element properly, and include the fallback url between them? please explain.

Go the the W3.org site and look up the VIDEO element. Find the part that describes permitted attributes. That is where you will find your explanation.
Part of the reasoning is that ALT text describes a static image, not a changing one. That is what closed captioning is for.

But consider a situation where a blind person has used a device that can’t play the video. How will he know there was a video and it isn’t supported?

Welcome to the forums, @beta6078252934,
The video element has a text node where we write the message,
Your device does not support video

still the concept is not clear. what does the alt tag represents that it can’t be used in a video tag? what if i write <video src =“xyz.mp4”  controls alt=“The video is about a grizzly bear”.> why is that wrong?




 mtf:

Thanks for the suggetion.




 arcsolver75719:

I hate to bring this back up again, but could you give an example?

You can’t give an external link under alt here at codecademy and have it display automatically. I tried.
    <img src=""https://content.codecademy.com/courses/web-101/web101-image_brownbeat.jpg"" alt=""https://content.codecademy.com/courses/web-101/web101-image_brownbear.jpg""/>

I misspelled bear(beat) so it would use the alt. If this is giving the link then sure you gave it and it displayed in the browser. The person using this web-page would then need to copy/paste the link to another browser tab to see the image.

Makes sense! Thank you!

Interesting topic, reminds me of the issue of naming variables in programming at large. I used “Brown Bear in Forest”, but even just “Bear” might suffice if we take into consideration that the surrounding text mentions that we are talking about brown bears.

Hi, Roy. I am still not clear about this topic.



 rubyslayer42889:

For example, if the video doesn’t load we might want to display a link to another video that does. As attributes can not contain markup, this scenario would not be possible with alt attributes alone.


The following code is an example of the fallback. The content inside the opening and closing <video></video> tags is shown as a fallback in browsers. Not all browsers support the same video format, so we can provide multiple video sources in the  element, and the browser will use the first source it supports.
<video controls width=""250"">

    <source src=""/media/examples/flower.webm""
            type=""video/webm"">

    <source src=""/media/examples/flower.mp4""
            type=""video/mp4"">

    Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos.
</video>

In terms of alt attribute, I don’t understand why you mentioned that attributes can not contain markup. Does this mean using the alt attribute to include a fallback video source? I assume the alt attribute does not need to include any HTML mark up (tags), and just include some descriptive words. So I think the fallback options have nothing to do with alt attribute. Could you please answer this question again without mentioning fallback? 
I know the alt attribute is not the permitted attributes for Video element, but I really don’t understand the reason.    If the alt attribute is valid for video element, I think this alt attribute can work for any source of the video. I tried the following code and my Chrome browser still plays the video normally.
<video controls width=""250"" alt=""Flowers are in bloom"">

    <source src=""/media/examples/flower.webm""
            type=""video/webm"">

    <source src=""/media/examples/flower.mp4""
            type=""video/mp4"">

    Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos.
</video>


If you look at the specs for VIDEO, you will find that there is no alt attribute in its attribute list. We want the user agent to slip down to the fallback text, which is neither descriptive or alternate text.
Attributes won’t have any effect beyond what they are purposed for. That includes alt, so including it won’t show any signs of malfunction. Upload the HTML to a validator and it may advise that the alt is not expected.

45,How can I link to a file on my own computer?,"FAQ,HTML FAQ",,5,"
Question
How can I link to a file on my own computer?
Answer
If you are working locally and you wish to link to another file, you usually want this other file to share the same parent directory as the file from which you are linking. This allows you to use a relative path as the value to an anchor’s href attribute. You will learn more about how to create relative paths in exercise 8 of this lesson.
","
I think in modern browsers the files have to be in the Web directory of your Web Server, you can no longer link directly to files that are elsewhere on the local machine.



Consider the possible locations for resources on a web connected computer.
file://
http://
https://

Just because we are working locally doesn’t mean we can’t use web URLs in our requests. For instance, say we have a development environment on our local machine that we wish to share across other devices. It follows the more resources we have on the web the less we need to share between the devices. Ultimately, the only thing shared between devices is the APP that drives everything.
Okay, that was a mouthful. The point it makes is that it makes perfect sense to establish a web, or cloud presence for shared content so devices don’t need to carry that extra baggage. Having it on demand is the way to go.
Create an account with a decent CDN and upload all media to that store. Now the URLs in your app point to that resource, not your local volume.
Now focus on containerizing your app. That’s where Angular.js, Express.js and React.js come in (and where I leave off).

E.g None

using <select> element:

you have a multiple attribute, which, well i suppose you can guess what it does 

I know I am 6 months from the last reply, but who knows who may stumble upon this question
I don’t believe that you have the option to not select something from the drop down, for the webpage to compile and run the code, each line be able to be ran. However, if you wish to customize a default option lets say if none of the items listed are of interest you can use the following <option selected=""selected"">: or <option selected>
<select id=""choice"" name=""choice"">
  <option selected=""selected""> (you can leave this blank) </option>
  <option value=""1""> 1 </option>
 <option value=""2""> 2 </option>

but not choosing options 1 or 2, you just click on the blank dropdown box.

I know this question has been answered already. Just wanted to contribute what I learnt from my own trial and error.
There is a way to make a default.
I tried it out by creating an  with an empty value attribute and added the text ‘selected’ afterwards, thus:

Why do we need to specify the name of the form we use when using labels, isn’t <label> just like a <p> ?

It is not like P in the true sectioning aspect since it applies to only a single INPUT.
<label for=""id"">ID</label> <input id=""id"">

or,
<label>ID <input></label>

Note that when the label wraps the input it does not require a for attribute. INPUT is a child of the element. When the two elements are sibling elements, we need to specify which input field the label applies to.

Why do we include <h1> and <p> elements in <form> element?
If we have <label> that determines context of <input> element, than what is the goal of<h1> and <p> elements in<form></form> part of the page?
Is it a bad idea to write header and paragraph before (and more independently) <form></form> element?

Inside a form element, H1 and P are generally there to inform the user. They are not form controls, but signal the type of input expected.
LABEL is for individual form controls. They tell the user (and user agent) what that particular field is expected to contain. labels are not headings unless we view them in the specialized sense of the word.

I’m a little fuzzy on the verbiage here and hope someone can help me understand it a little better.
 <label for=""username"">Username</label>
        <input type=""text"" name=""username"" id=""username"">

What is the difference between ‘name’ and ‘id’ as it pertains to 1) the code and 2) the output?

 byte8999933367:

What is the relationship between ‘label for=‘meal’’ and ‘id=‘meal’’?


for and id associate the label with the input element.

I think it’s starting to make sense. So in this example
<label for=""name"">Who Are You?</label>

The element  designates the section of the code that will output, and so ‘name’ is arbitrary. It just makes deciphering the code easier to know what is being referenced?
<input type=""text"" name=""name"" id=""name"">

The element  then calls out the type of input as ‘text’ as opposed to an integer or something else. And the ‘name’ and ‘id’ are simply references to the section of the code that designates this particular field. Is that correct? And if so, are the call outs for ‘name’ and ‘id’ redundant?

id and name have distinctly different purposes, so clearly they are not redundant.
Every form control that is intended to be transmitted to a server based handler on Submit will have a unique name. When the user clicks Submit, the form is parsed into key-value pairs in a special POSTDATA object. The name is the key, and control value is the value in this pair.
id is a page fragment identifier, and ties back to the label attribute, for. It has no role in the handling of the form data.

For those still wondering why we need both name and id attributes, it becomes clear in section 8.

this is not a reply it is a question: can the input tag have type,name,id and value attributes all together in one tag or some have to exists separately but in the same form tag. plus i dont know how to ask a question

Why should that not be possible? Each attribute serves a distinct purpose, so they can be used together on a single <input> element.




 brianshivina34107152:

can the input tag have type,name,id and value attributes all together in one tag


As long as we understand the exact purpose being served we can use which attributes we see a need for. Is the form being submitted to a form handler on the server? If yes, then it MUST have a name attribute and value attribute, as applies to the specific control. These are paired up in the POST DATA as &name=value. Does the input have a unique handler on the client side, then very likely an id attribute will help to facilitate this. Is the control one of the non-text type? Then a type attribute will be needed to describe it.
Rather than thinking in terms of what should be there think in terms of actual purpose and need. Don’t think in terms of rules, but intended use.

In the 4th lesson of creating a form, the name and id attributes inside the input tag are the same. Does it make a difference whether they are different or the same?


often you want logic names for name and id, so often they are the same. You see many sites do this. You can have different names, but its not common to do so

placeholder attribute can do the same work. So there’s no need of  element.

Section 5: What function does the name vs. id vs. label have again (The ‘label for’ links to ‘id’, so what does ‘name’ do? Sorry for the trouble!!

 jackolien:

@jackolien This is just a beginner’s guess, but I think it’s excluded because if we add the in-between text, then the word is rendered twice on the list - it also shows the value, so I ended up with “ketchup  …     Ketchup”, “mayo  …   Mayo”, etc. when I added in the text to see what happens. Unfortunately that leaves us with uncapitalized words in the list…maybe CSS could alter that? I’m not that far yet 
EDIT: Looking over the exercise again, in the left/instructions pane Codecademy capitalized their values in the datalist example, I wasn’t aware we were allowed to do that, but that fixes the list items being capitalized.

Gosh, thank you!! I was wracking my brain wondering why it wasn’t working.
Cheers!


ScreenshotForForum2.png1285×621 91.2 KB

The screenshot shows that I had a different output with the datalist than shown in the lesson text: for me, the HTML values appeared to the user! In the left of the screenshot it shows what it is supposed to be (what the lesson text shows), and in the right of the screenshot it shows how it actually rendered, with both the values and the text that was supposed to be shown. Is this normal? Does the codecademy lesson text image need to be updated? The previous form types shown to us did not have the value appear to the user (e.g. with the checkbox lesson).
Thanks.


Well, I actually don’t know but to me it seems like it’s optional if the value corresponds to what you actually want to have shown.
In my example “honey” shows up like that even though I wrote nothing in the content of the element. While if I do write something then the content replaces what is shown. It could be handy if in the value you want to register you don’t want to take capitalization into account but actually want “Ketchup” to show up.
Not sure if that’s how it is for you or for others, but it might also be browser related? I’m using firefox.

Same in Safari as well. It only renders the word equaled to the value attribute. The word between the  tags aren’t presented on the datalist under the input box

Safari now supports datalist from its version 12.1, released March 25, 2019, according to caniuse.com.
But as reported in this discussion thread, how the text inserted between the opening and closing  tags shows up appears to differ across browsers…

You can do it, but it’ll show up under the option, like this:
ketchup
ketchup
mayo
mayo
This trick is useful for websites that deal with limited-seating events or ticket sales, because the text between the opening and closing tags can set up to display a returned value.  Other times, it can display a very brief description of the listed option .  Outside of that, however, it’s confusing and takes up screen space… which is always at a premium, especially with tablets and smartphones.

I realize this is an old thread but it’s an interesting observation from karolisvaitkevicius6, I think he might be right about the end result being reflective of which browser you are using. I am using Chrome and like agentgenx I got a double up of “sauces” in my drop down list when I entered the text between the opening and closing tags.

the difference between how the name is display has to do with how you wrote it down, if you put the exact same thing in the “value” label and in between the opening and closing tag, it will show you just one value, but instead if theres a difference then it will show two different values.

“When the form is submitted, the value of the  <input> ‘s  name  and the  value  of the option selected, or what the user typed in, is sent as a pair.”
how will the system know the value that the user typed in  if it is not from the values that are preseted?

why didn’t we write the value as a content between the option tag as in select lesson?

For the future viewers seeing this lecture on Mozilla, what you have to do as it’s a <datalist> and not a <select>, you have to start typing on the box to view the options predefined of the <datalist>. Do not worry, your code is alright!

49,Why should we use CSS rather than HTML to create borders for our tables?,"FAQ,HTML FAQ",q-a,27,"
Question
Why should we use CSS rather than HTML to create borders for our tables?
Answer
Within software engineering, there is a design principle known as “separation of concerns” which aims to create scalable, more easily maintainable coding architectures. For web developers, this principle guides us to keep our structure (HTML) separate from our presentation (CSS).
","
Where in HTML code should I use CSS to add borders?

You will reference a .css file from your .html file in which you will have written all the code necessary to style your webpage (including table borders) rather than adding it onto your .html file 

cant we just use div to border them?

I totally understand the explanation, But in my opinion, it still does not make sense.
Code process always should be simple and easy. By separating ‘making borders’ from html, we are not making it easy, but complicated.
I prefer the old way.

Honestly, I still do not get this.

I agree with you. But being a pro entails being competent and adopting a proper professional way of doing things.

Hold on… You are not the only one 

Not a pro but I understand the intention or principle here. The goal of your html  file is to setup and define the structure and content of your page. It’s better to keep the styling (CSS) separate so that you can style similar and related content in one swoop.
With the old way, you would need to style every element or structure (eg. tables, list) individually in the html. With the new way you can style just one, a few or any amount of elements you the designer deem similar in function or purpose or position very easily.
Hope this helps.

Zormus nailed it. I’m not pro on this either but it makes sense that it’d be cleaner to separate style from substance. If HTML is like the skeleton and muscular systems that make up the core pieces of a page, CSS is like the skin put over top of it; your skin is one large organ with consistent properties of its own that only have to be defined once, and if you had separate skin systems to cover each limb of your skeleton/musculature structure, that would create lots of unnecessary extra seams and internal complex joinery, which creates room for more flaws and errors and also makes the whole system messier to examine or mentally break down.

Thanks! Helped me) as I just wondered why I have to use different types of notations for single page.

Here’s the thing…you don’t. Eventually, we’ll get to the point where we have taken the codeacademy.com CSS course and are ready to collaborate code.
(for example) Having an index.html  file tab open in our Text Editor/IDE  while simultaneously writing code in a .css tab that would point directly to the second row of the table.
OR you can INSERT the CSS code like illustrated in the image below although is trickier and it is recommended by most professionals to keep codes separate.

I’m new to this as well, but I don’t believe div produces an actual physical effect on the webpage. We use  in order to group a certain section of our code, so that we can easily style it later with CSS or something else.

If you put everything in the same box “html” file, you will be creating a messy code and unreadable.

If you put everything in the same box “html” file, you will be creating a messy code and unreadable.
This is why CSS is important.

This post was flagged by the community and is temporarily hidden.

So, according to the matters of this discussion, borders would be CSS oriented?  Thus, it is regarded as “separation of concerns”?

Creating borders, making the table look good belows to the desing aspect of a website. Therefore, CSS would be better sutied for it. HTML is used for content eg. adding words, tables and pictures.
I found a good short video that would explain this concept well.

Hope it helps! Enjoy learning!

50,Why do we need to use 2-space indentations?,"FAQ,HTML FAQ",q-a,4,"
Question
If  the spacing in our HTML documents doesn’t affect the positioning of content on the page, why do we need to use 2-space indentations?
Answer
Experienced developers use indentation and vertical spacing to keep their code neat and legible. Highly readable code improves maintainability, aides collaborative efforts and makes for a better developer experience overall.
Within our HTML, consistent indentation should be used to illustrate nesting. For more info, check out this chapter.
","


You don’t have to use 2 spaces HTML does not care about spacing outside of literals (e.g. quoted text). I particularly dislike spaces because it is not as adaptive as tab spacing. In fact, you can write the entirety of an html document on a single line (though if you do, look for your boss to fire you as soon as you turn it in as complete.) What you must do, is follow the style guide for the people for whom you are working (unless you want to be fired ).  If your company says use two spaces, use two spaces. If they say use four spaces, use four spaces. If they tell you to use tab spacing, do it.

51,Do we need to use both ID and name? Can they be the same?,"FAQ,HTML FAQ",forms,2,"
In regards to the  element, why do we use the ‘id’ and ‘name’ attribute when both have the same value?
My understanding is the ‘id’ attribute is required to connect with correct label element while the ‘name’ attribute is just a unique name for the input element.
","



 danielprusac26379953:

In regards to the element, why do we use the ‘id’ and ‘name’ attribute when both have the same value?


The name attribute is used in the HTTP request sent by your browser to the server. The id  is for CSS and JavaScript as a reference that the element with that id.
They do not have to be the same but they can be as in the case in the tutorial.
Id's must be unique to the tag that it is inside and only used once on any given html page.
name doesn’t have to be unique, for example there are cases where you would use it many times with radio buttons.
Here’s a link to an example where the name attribute is used many times:

The HTML fieldset element is used to group several controls as well as labels (label) within a web form.

52,What is a section element?,"FAQ,HTML FAQ",forms,9,"
The lesson “Learn HTML: Forms - How a Form Works” seems to introduce the section element without any explanation. I searched for more information on the section element (and when we should use it) on Codecademy but only found the FAQ forum post “FAQ: Semantic HTML - Section Element” from October 2018 that seemed to indicate that the section element used to be described in the lesson “Semantic HTML.” However, I can no longer find this lesson.
I tried to look up the difference between the section element and the div element on this Stack Overflow post, but am still confused. Could Codecademy please bring back the “Semantic HTML” lesson or other lesson that covers the section element? I would like to know more about when to use the section element (and not) and have the section element described in plain English.
(Also, it makes me curious as to if lessons on HTML that were previously accessible have since been made inaccessible?)
Thank you.

To learn about semantic HTML, I recommend this CodeCademy video:

Also I myself have written about it after quite a bit of trial and error to figure out how to properly use semantic HTML elements such as : https://medium.com/@masakudamatsu/semantic-html-as-graphic-design-without-graphics-ac98e9c2d756
Hope these help!

Thanks MasaKu, that was a good and clarifying read

in this section of course i’am seeing different tags like “meta,link,section” which are not even introduced before.How can i understand what those tags are doing???

I couldn’t get what an http is and the connection and method thing , can someone recommend mea video ?

Did you saw the link they provided in the lecture?
It’s pretty straightforward and gives you a basic idea of how it works. It even makes an analogy in the case you haven’t understand it. Last but not least they also provide you another link to try yourself to see how it works with the Inspector Element from Google Chrome’s Developer Tools. I’ve managed to know how to see it in Firefox myself without checking on Google and it’s pretty fun.
If you still have doubts about it, you can simply search what is HTTP on Google and see the result. If you prefer to see videos, you can search on YouTube.

thank you! I’ll check the link again 

The  tag is used to link stylesheet files to your HTML files. In other words, you use it to link your CSS file with your HTML file. I wouldn’t worry about it too much right now, as I imagine that they’ll explain what it is in the CSS course. I haven’t a clue on what  and  does, but I guess that  is probably very similar to the  tag.

Hi, I am a beginner here but I believe if you rephrase your question(s), there will be a few people here who can help.
Thanks
","
Thanks mega4175851005, my question was messy.
So hi again ! 
When do we have to choose between VIDEO or EMBED?
I try to put a video with EMBED and it works !
What is the main differences?
If someone can enlighten me, I’ll be pleased !

Hi,
The VIDEO element makes it clear that the developer is attempting to display a video to the user. It has an opening and closing tag.
The EMBED element is also used to incorporate media content into a web page. It can embed any media including videos, audio files, and gifs from external and local sources. It is a self-closing tag.
I hope this helps 

From what I have read up on it, it depends on the developer on which tag they want to use.
However, these days, as a general rule, <video> is used for videos, <audio> for audio content, and <embed> for anything else, like flash videos and gifs.
Kevin

Ok thanks @zs-kev, that makes sense to use  for flash videos and gifs.

I didn’t understand why we needed to add both a video tag and an embed tag. If the [video src=“link.mp4”][/video] already worked to show a video, what was the point of embedding and additional .gif link?
(I also had this question for the audio section, separating the [audio] tag from the [source] tag, but figured the reasoning would become clear in the next step. It didn’t! Got more confused. Lol.)
Just realized that this chat box renders HTML, so I replaced the carrots with brackets! I know there’s a way to show code, but forgot what tags are used.

If <embed> can use any form of media what is the point of using <image> <video> <audio> ?

Video, audio, and image tags are utilized to tell other coders or the program itself what the intended purpose is. For example, when using the video tag, it tells other people that your intention is to apply a video and only a video. Hope this helps!

I think it was largely for the sake of the example, to show us other pieces of code. The embed gif I guess is supposed to entertain the user while the video loads. Maybe it was used more when video took time to load due to decreased bandwidths.

Not sure if this is helpful, but I’ve used embed tags to use videos from my YouTube channel for my reel on my website (instead of using local files with a video tag). I am not sure if you can use external URLs with video tags.

No, that doesn’t help. You are simply saying what the lecture says. He ask when to use each of them. The south-african man has answered correctly. Read properly the questions and then answer if you know the answers.

One thing i have noticed that i would like to point out is when we use the<audio> tag, the audio file renders on the page in a bar with round edges type of format. On the other hand if we use an <embed> tag to import an audio, the file renders with a black rectangle behind it.
This is in the case of Chrome, however in safari it showed an error.

hey everyone,Can we use the attributes that work with the video element within the embed element?

Hey, I realise this is an old post but thought I’d chime in…
As was previously introduced in the course, we ideally want to be using semantic markup, i.e. markup that gives the reader of our source code more meaningful information (be it a person or piece of software).
So when choosing between <video> or <embed>, bear this principle in mind. Yes, we could use an <embed> element for a video, which technically speaking would be just fine. But think of a screen reader or search engine trying to make sense of our code; using a <video> tag makes it 100% crystal clear that there is supposed to be a video there and not some other type of media. Likewise we should use <audio> and <img> tags as appropriate, and only use <embed> for anything else not covered by a specific tag.
There may be some other considerations to do with how each tag renders the media, but this is the main lesson here I think

I agree, this is a great rule to follow! It just makes the most sense given the fact that this topic was mentioned during the Semantic HTML unit.

Hi!
I agree that the video tag should be used if it’s the video you insert, purely for semantic purposes.
I also found that the video tag may provide more additional useful possibilities, like inserting different video files with source tags:

Browsers don’t all support the same video formats; you can provide multiple sources inside nested [source] elements, and the browser will then use the first one it understands.

Question
For step 1 of this exercise,  is “A photo of a brown bear’s head” good alt text to use?
Answer
This text certainly is descriptive and you are off to a great start here! With few exceptions, we generally want to avoid phrases like “photo of…”, “graphic of …”, “image of …” with our alt attributes as this information is usually redundant. I would recommend the more concise yet sufficiently descriptive alt value of  “Brown Bear”.

Track down what the real use of alternate text is. It is important to not abuse it for SEO purposes or leverage it for marketing purposes. Let it be a concern of well-formedness rather than the bottom line.
Until one understands the need for accessibility, all the remaining explanations are meaningless. Why even use the alt="""" attribute? Just for show?
Alternate text is meant for people and user agents who/which literally cannot see. Blind people are blind. So too are search robots. Search engines are blind and use the data surrounding an image to give it some idea of how to index the image. The alternate text is the most specific since it is in the same tag as the src attribute. They must be connected is how a search engine will see it.
To a blind person, the alternate text does its best to describe the picture that the sighted user can see, in a brief phrase. The user will be able to browse the page and come across a descripton of an image then continue reading. If that description fits the context of what they are reading then it will be meaningfull and experiential. If not, well the experience could be less than pleasant and the page visit lost on the user. Accessibility means including everyone in the same relative experience.

Excelente, bien explicado.

My alt text read “a brown bear looks off wistfully into the distance” 




 nbornstein:

“a brown bear looks off wistfully into the distance”


ALT text is objective, not subjective. We’re not writing or poem or narrating a drama. It is not the purpose of alternate text to denote tone or to emote, but to describe as simply as possible what is the principal object in the image.

My alt tag for this was “A very cute brown bear. It’s looking right at the camera. What are you doing? You need to get out of there! That’s a bear!”
Is that a good alt tag?




 burgerdessert:

Is that a good alt tag?


No, it is far to subjective. ALT text must be explicit, concise and objective. We would only use adjectives that are critical, such as brown bear as opposed to black bear, etc. We would never narrate and only use verbs that are also critical to the objectivity. Eg. brown bear sitting on honches.



 burgerdessert:

What are you doing? You need to get out of there! That’s a bear!”


An unsighted person is not very likely to be standing that near to a dangerous wild animal. This is superfluous narration.

HTML Page14.jpg960×720 60.5 KB


Alternate text only displays while waiting for the image to download. Then it is hidden. MS browsers can see the text on mouseover (as a tooltip) but others do not (afaik). For those browsers we would put in an additional attribute, title="""" which text will display as a tooltip in all browsers.

Thank you very much!

See the post above… ALT text does not display on mouseover in most browsers, only IE as far as I know. Edge may be different.

< p>Duie Mragnea< /p>
","
I’m also having concerns on this one. It displayed the content though it’s outside the body.

@sant513 @ciellyberry @radu_moon  no need to be concerned. The correct format for a document is:
<! DOCTYPE html>

    <html>
        <head>
               For title and links to scripts etc. 
        </head>

        <body>
                For content of the site e.g divs
        </body>
    </html>

If your code is laid out in any other way a browser isn’t guaranteed to display it correctly.
Browsers create DOMs (document object models) from your code, and if your code has tags outside of body or head this can mess up the model and create some weirdly rendered results.
However browsers assume users might do things a bit wrong, so if you have tags outside the body tag they might assume you should have put it in the body tags and process it as if you had done so. But the important thing is every browser does this differently, so if you’re format isn’t correct it could look different on every single browser. To guarantee your HTML is processed the same on every browser you should put tags you want displayed inside the body tag.

Same here I would also like to know this and it was said anything outside the body tag is not displayed but it seems to be working just fine. Text still displays outside of the body tag when type is there a reason for this?

If you want the technical answer, I don’t know. If you want the one that answers why simply compiles fine, the answers is above your comment.

Question
Without the html tags mentioned in this lesson, in what ways might the browser misinterpret our HTML code?
Answer
The <html> tag is actually an example of an optional tag which means that there are situations in which it can be omitted. Even though omitted optional tags will be inserted into the document by the browser and may not always be required, most developers would say that it is best practice to include these tags. Including optional tags enhances readability, improves cross-browser support, and takes some burden off of the browser.
In short, while the <html> tag can be omitted I do not believe it should be omitted.

This is a big improvement over my first try. I think I'm getting the idea of coding.
. 
I hope this is 100% right.

Read up on essay outlines and consider that an analogy to a document outline. There is no sort order for headings, only hierarchy or as you deduced, importance.

Is there any difference between <p> and <body>? Cause when I used both only content inside the opening and closing  tags was displayed to the screen.

Tags do not appear on the screen, only what content they surround. The markup is for the browser (and a reader or user agent) to read and interpret.



 rezmalek:

Is there any difference between <p> and <body> ?


A very big difference. <body></body> is the main content container, one of only two direct children of the <html></html> root element, the other being the <head></head>.
Paragraphs are text containers and their element tags indicate this. We could never write,.
<p><body></body></p>

since BODY is the main container, and cannot be written anywhere else except in the HTML element.
<html>
  <head>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p></p>
  </body>
</html>

Thanks for your prompt reply, it was very helpful1

I don’t understand,  what paragraph and title are you talking about?  I don’t see the title “My Coding Journey” on this lesson.  Thank you for your time!

The <title></title> element is written in the <head></head> so the browser can insert it into the tab text or the window bar text. It does not appear in our webpage, proper since it is not part of the content, but the meta data.
<p></p> is a plain text container intended for paragraphical content, and perhaps images.

 Are you replying to me, @mtf?  If so I sure do appreciate it, the only problem is I don’t know where the op is talking about?  I go to the lesson, which paragraph is being asked about?
Is the op asking about the code on the whole web page of the lesson it self, or a specific example in the lesson?

I think what was meant was that “My Coding Journey” was something the user inserted themselves and didn’t see because they placed it as a title. Here’s a screenshot to better emphasize that:

Very confusing for sure! I thought the question had something to do with the URL only saying “http://localhost/” instead of “http://codecademy.com/localhost/” or something

Question
Without the html tags mentioned in this lesson, in what ways might the browser misinterpret our HTML code?
Answer
The <html> tag is actually an example of an optional tag which means that there are situations in which it can be omitted. Even though omitted optional tags will be inserted into the document by the browser and may not always be required, most developers would say that it is best practice to include these tags. Including optional tags enhances readability, improves cross-browser support, and takes some burden off of the browser.
In short, while the <html> tag can be omitted I do not believe it should be omitted.

62,Do we always have to add JavaScript in the HTML file directly?,"FAQ,HTML FAQ",,3,"
Question
In this exercise, the JavaScript code is placed inside the <script> tags. Do we always have to add the JavaScript in the HTML file directly in this manner?
Answer
No, you do not always have to add JavaScript directly into the HTML code using the <script> tags.
Another way you can apply JavaScript to a webpage is by linking to an external JavaScript file instead. This can be a good idea because it will keep the code separate, and apply the idea of “separation of concerns”. However, you are free to choose either method to add your JavaScript code.
To link an external JavaScript file to the HTML, we can use the <script> tag with the src attribute. For example, this will link a JavaScript file named “index.js” to the webpage:
<script src=""index.js""></script>
This is usually added right before the closing </body> tag, due to how the browser would load the files.
","
Why can’t we link the index.js file using the href attribute instead of src attribute? Like we did for the CSS file? Thanks in advance!

Well, I looked around for a good answer/explanation, and most answers I found refer back to this topic on stackoverflow: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3395359/difference-between-src-and-href
Read at least the first 3 answers. Explains it pretty well.

63,"What does ""document type"" mean?","FAQ,HTML FAQ","elements-structure,q-a",8,"
what does document type means?
","
Document type means you are telling to the browser what type of document you are submitting to the browser.Reason for using document type in the beginning of the hmtl script is while running that script in the browser it will understand that it is an html document,so the browser will arrange the document in hmtl formate and run rest of the script properly and the it gives output.

Document type is simply telling the computer what file this is. This can be html file, text file, php file and so on.

The Document Type states what type of code you are using. EX.
<!DOCTYPE html>

Shows that you are using HTML5

Think of it as two people who know multiple languages and want to begin a conversation. First, they must agree on what language to communicate in. Identifying html as the DOCTYPE is declaring the language that is about to be spoken is html.

I’m a total beginner, but I think of it as telling the OS which language the code is written in so that it can interpret and present it correctly.  Just hope I’m right in thinking that way.

telling the computer? Or telling the browser?
Browsers were implemented to read html documents(html can be written in previous versions of html eg html4,3,2 or even 1 ) but you always have to specify what html you are writing, inside the html document!

The OS? We are talking about browsers. Operating Systems are a whole other thing.

64,This exercise discusses the `scope` attribute. What is the purpose of the scope attribute and are row and col the only values this attribute can have?,"FAQ,HTML FAQ",q-a,12,"
Question
This exercise discusses the scope attribute. What is the purpose of the scope attribute and are row and col the only values this attribute can have?
Answer
The scope attribute is used by screen readers to enhance accessibility for visually impaired users. In addition to the row and col values shown in this exercise, the scope attribute can also have the following values:

rowgroup: used for table headings that group multiple rows.
colgroup:used for table headings that group multiple columns.
auto: the default value

In lessons 8 and 9 you will learn how to create cells that span multiple rows or columns. For improved accessibility, we should use the appropriate rowgroup and colgroup values within these headings.
","
Then can we say that scope attribute is an optional attribute? The browser creates the columns even without adding scope attribute.




 sethh0743661318:

can we say that scope attribute is an optional attribute?


Almost everything about HTML is optional. There are dozens of attributes that may be applied to any particular element. If there are none, the user agent is left to follow its own assumptions based on the namespace and how it compares to the specifications.
Take for instance a TABLE element. If there are no attributes, the browser will look to the style sheet and follow the cascade from the UA defaults, then the imported/embedded and inline styles down to the User styles. It will glean whatever information it can to help it calculate how to draw the element.
<html>
<head>
  <style>
  table { border: 5px solid orange }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <table></table>
</body>
<html>

We could comment on how much required stuff is missing, but this will still render perfectly in most modern browsers. Some other user agents, such as search engines and screen readers may find their hands tied and decide not to index the page, or make a mess of rendering the page for the listener… Who knows?
More to the point, what do we see on the screen? Answer: Nothing.
The TABLE element does not have a width or height attribute unless we give it one, either in the markup or in the style sheet. So an empty table element, even with a border, does not render.
Recall that by the default box model the border is drawn inside the element. Pretty hard to draw the border when there is no room. The browser does nothing that it shouldn’t be able to do.
Replace the selector rule with this,
  table {
    border: 5px solid orange;
    width: 10px;
    height: 10px;
  }

Now you should see the tiny orange block on your screen.
But enough of that. Certainly scope attributes are not required. If ever you are in doubt, refer to the W3C element list for HTML5. Each element is described, and all the required or allowed attributes are listed. Dig a little deeper and we can find a complete list of all the attributes, both global and element specific. The latter group is where we find scope as it pertains only to TH elements (as far as I know without actually checking; correct me if I’m wrong).
Some attributes are about position and size, while others are about semantics. They add meaning, just as their element type gives information and meaning.
At the core of standards and guidelines is well-formedness, a term that every serious web developer knows very well. They treat their HTML creations like the work of art they are. All manner of expert knowledge is applied to the creation of a well formed web document. Standards and Accessibility Guidelines are there to help us all reach that height.
scope is an attribute that has a specific purpose… To paint the target so the user agent doesn’t have to rely upon any of its own assumptions. Scope gives a row or column group meaning. However indistinct and unrelated the data may be, they have that one thing in common. The same TH.
Off on a tangent… Let’s say we have an IMG element with only a src attribute. How will that image render? No surprise there, the browser will render what it takes down from the server in its exact dimensions. However in order to do that it had to wait for the image to download (hence the image placehoder) and then read the image’s header to find the dimensions, then add them into its calculations (are scrollbars needed, for instance) then finally draw it on the screen. During the whole waiting process, other objects are being drawn to the screen, but they are going to jump into new positions when the image pops in.
When we furnish the dimension information in attributes (markup or CSS), the browser does not need to wait for the image to download. It just reserves the screen space and continues drawing the rest of the page elements to the screen. When the image finally arrives it will just pop onto the screen and nothing will be shifted. It’ll be like it was meant to be.
This is where well-formedness shines at its best. It informs the user agent so less assumptions and fallbacks come into play. That’s another aspect to attributes.

This is no doubt the best explanation of the ‘scope’ attribute I have seen so for anywhere on the Web. Thank you!

Hi,
I’ve been trying to work this out for an hour and am lost. I have tried scope=col and scope=row combinations and it’s not working.
This is my code:


Company Name
Number of Items to Ship
Next Action


Adam's Greenworks
14
Package Items


As someone who is trying to get into coding, I find these experiences frustrating and disheartening. Why is the solution code not readily available to review and troubleshoot rather than wasting so much time?




 clayton.black:

|Company Name|Number of Items to Ship|Next Action


Each of those TH’s would be given COL scope as they head the respective column groups.

Thanks for your help. Eventually I really don’t know what fixed it… CodeAcademy seems to have a lot of problems and isn’t particularly user friendly.

The scope attribute for table data is not supported by HTML5: “The  scope attribute is not supported in HTML5.”
Why is it being included in Codecademy? Should we not use the attribute “scope” for table data cells?
(Also, is this the right spot to post my question? This is my first post on Codecademy.)


While the statement may be correct in terms of TD, it is not correct in terms of TH.

https://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-html5-author-20110809/the-th-element.html

TD is not intended as a header element, by a data element. Data does not have or need scope, only headers need this.

Thank you very much for your reply with the clarification!
(Also, I found the w3schools article on TH scope: “https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_th_scope.asp”, which doesn’t mention any issue with HTML5.)
Have a great day.

I would suggest bookmarking the w3.org site, and also MDN which is the site that W3C shares their information with. Not really a big fan w3schools, given we have much better and genuine authorities to whom we can turn to for reliable information.

65,Should the alt attribute show up when hovering on the image?,"FAQ,HTML FAQ","elements-structure,q-a",11,"
I also had that problem - I added the alt attribute but I can’t see any text when I hover over the image.
","
The alt attribute is not meant to be visible unless there’s an issue loading the image.


The alt attribute also serves the following purposes: (click here)

If an image fails to load on a web page, a user can mouse over the area originally intended for the image and read a brief description of the image. This is made possible by the description you provide in the  alt  attribute.
Visually impaired users often browse the web with the aid of screen reading software. When you include the  alt  attribute, the screen reading software can read the image’s description out loud to the visually impaired user.
The  alt  attribute also plays a role in Search Engine Optimization (SEO), because search engines cannot “see” the images on websites as they crawl the internet. Having descriptive  alt  attributes can improve the ranking of your site.

: The Image Embed element
The HTML img element embeds an image into the document.







The only browser to show the tooltip  (for alt) when hovering was IE. Whether EDGE does, or not one cannot say. If you want a tooltip on hover, then include a title attribute.
alt and title are not the same thing, and not interchangeable. Search engines and screen readers can see both. ALT is intended to be brief and concise, and should never be used for SEO purposes. They are a requirement under accessibility guidelines. TITLE can be more descriptive, give more detail and be less brief. It can be leveraged for SEO.
We can style tooltips with CSS by using an attribute selector, afaik.

Oh, thanks. that makes more sense.

Thanks a lot! I have been worrying about this for minuter!

Well explained. Thanks

 method9996800044:

Having descriptive alt attributes can improve the ranking of your site.


Well that may be, when used in a natural way. Many would be SEOers have leveraged alternate text in any number of ways to curry favor in the keyword competition, rather than letting it serve its principal purpose…assistive technology.

Wouldn’t that contradict what the course is saying below?

The  alt  attribute also plays a role in Search Engine Optimization (SEO), because search engines cannot “see” the images on websites as they crawl the internet. Having descriptive  alt attributes can improve the ranking of your site.





 swiftcoder1:

Having descriptive alt attributes can improve the ranking of your site.


That is a blanket generalization. Can affect the ranking, not improve it. There are hundreds of factors. This is one very small concern. It’s primary purpose is assistive technology users, not search engines. It’s the belief in that statement that had SEOers gaming the system years ago until search engines devalued any boost to rankings ALT may have previously offered.

Conclusion? The course is a little bit outdated and the alt is used for blind people rather than for improving SEO. It makes sense as this ranking strategy may vary over time and browsers may change too in order to stop practices that boost certain webpages.

66,Are there differences between `name` and `id`?,"FAQ,HTML FAQ","forms,q-a",12,"
Are the “name” and “id” always the same? what is an example of when we would need them to be different?
","
Hello and welcome on the site 
They can be different, Id is to identify the element in CSS or in JS, name is to identify element in HTML and in PHP for form handling
Hope this helps 

This question has been asked many times in this HTML Forms unit, and the best answer I’ve seen so far is this: FAQ: Learn HTML: Forms - Adding a Label

I’ve noticed that the instructions mention name but not id, however to pass the code you need to have both.

Use name attributes for form controls, as that’s the identifier used in the POST or GET call that happens on form submission.
Use id attributes whenever you need to address a particular HTML element with CSS, JavaScript or a fragment identifier.
It’s possible to look up elements by name too, but it’s simpler and more reliable to look them up by ID.
Name is used for form handling in PHP when a form is submitted via HTML, name doesn’t have to be unique on a page, as it can link other elements together.
Hope this helps 

I still don’t get it.
Why is the id attribute to identify the element in CSS/JS even though in the lesson whe saw that it’s related to the attribute “for” in the label element (which is html language or I am wrong?)?
Sorry for my bad english!

Id is used in CSS and in JS as you said:
document.getElementById(""someId"") // javascript

#someId {
  color: green; /* CSS */
}

For is used for labeling as you said, and name too.
But beacuse Id-s are unique it’s easier to handle them in JavaScript.
So that name’s aren’t unique they return an array even if there is only one name, just like classes:
document.getElementsByName(""someName"") // Names

document.getElementsByClassName(""someClass"") // Classes

As I said they return an array so we target one of them with:
document.getElementsByName(""someName"")[0] // Names

document.getElementsByClassName(""someClass"")[0] // Classes

We can even target all of them (or some of them) with a for loop:
for (let i = 0; i < document.getElementsByClassName.length; i++) {
  document.getElementsByClassName[i].style.color = ""green"";
}

And we use names to work with forms in PHP.
Hope this helps 

Hello,
Just wondering if “name” and “id” must be passed to the same string. Can anyone help with this?

They’ve answered that question before. You can and is often see it on big companies as the moderator said in another FAQ.

Is there a way where Codecademy forum hightlights the code depending on the language?
For example python print(""Hello World"")
I don’t know I would like to have some colors in the text to differentiate the languages like Discord does.

Basically an ID isn’t going to have an effect on your actual html but it serves as a variable name in your CSS and Javascript, meanwhile a name is going to be the variable name to use in your html.

It makes sense, thank you

Question
In step 1 of this exercise, where should I create the table?
Answer
Add opening and closing <table> tags after the <div> element on line 17.
","


Why after div, why not after line 6?

I’m pretty new to this and could very well be wrong. I would think you would want it in the body of the html rather than in the head. We want the table to show as content in the body rather than metadata in the head. If someone with more experience could shed some light that would be great.

Newbie here so maybe a dumb question, should the <table> element be nested in the <div> or should it have the same indentation as the <div> nested within the <body>?

Please post a link to the exercise so we may better advise.
A table is a block level element so does not need a container, although giving it a wrapper means some of the page styling can be handed off to the that element, and style the table as needed for its own purpose.

Exercise: Create a table. link: https://www.codecademy.com/paths/web-development/tracks/learn-html-web-dev-path/modules/learn-html-tables/lessons/tables/exercises/create-table . Thanx for the quick response @mtf

As I’ve written it (mind, one needs to review the instructions) there is no container DIV. The TABLE is a sibling of ‘search’ and ‘nav’ elements.

Thank you sir. It seems obvious now (Im a few lessons down the road). Both your answers have very much cleared things up.

You’re welcome.
Aside
Even while this exercise creates a styled page, per se, the time devoted to learning about un-styled tables would be advisable, and well spent. The course explores things like colspan and rowspan, thead, th, and such, but only in brief on the grand scale of things. One would be well advised to delve into tables in full detail, before moving forward.
There is a lot to be learned with regard to composition, accessibility, dissemination by robots, and so forth. Truly, there is a lot to learn and know, even without CSS in the picture. Recall that robots and specialized user agents like screen readers don’t give two farthings when it comes to style. Making tables that they can understand is a goal at all times, front and center.
For lack of another example, forgive that I use my own from an earlier topic on the subject…

What is the difference between thead and th?

A robot or screen reader will look first at the CAPTION. Next they will create an index of the headings. Those with scope will be mapped to their column or row. A screen reader could answer the user as to what other items are on the same row, or in the same column.
We can go right down the rabbit hole in terms of how to make a table a truly beautiful thing to behold; would we really? The point I make is that there is always the usability and accessibility concern before us, as developers. Studying the TABLE element in the raw, as it were, is probably the best way to learn. A well constructed table needs no style sheet. It won’t be pretty, but it won’t be ugly, either. It will stand on its own.
We (the dev community) definitely discourage using any HTML attributes to give direction to presentation, meaning that while we could introduce borders, padding, and so on in HTML, it is so passe in today’s terms I wouldn’t even want to venture down that path.
I still say, don’t bring style into the frame until you’ve constructed many, many tables of all types and constructs to really have a feel for how they work. They’re malleable to an extent. Learn that extent. Define with markup and later shape with CSS.

Well, why we are using CSS code here…Though CSS code isn’t showing here and I think it doesn’t necessary in Beginner HTML

Question
This exercise says that attributes can provide information. What kind of information do attributes provide?
Answer
There are several different types of attributes which can extend tags in different ways. Usually attributes either change an element’s behavior, provide metadata about the element, or provide labeling information about the element. For example, the id attribute uniquely identifies an element whereas the class attribute identifies a whole group of elements. This labeling information can then be used to target content for styling, scripting, or (for the id attribute) linking.  For more information about these attributes, check out classes vs ids.

69,Don't <div> elements increase the complexity of our HTML structure?,"FAQ,HTML FAQ",q-a,3,"
Question
Adding <div> elements to our HTML document doesn’t seem to change anything on the page. What’s the point of nesting other elements within a <div>? Doesn’t this just increase the complexity of our HTML structure?
Answer
When using <div> tags as containers, it is true that our nesting might become more complex. However,  the benefit is that if we create a thoughtful HTML structure we can more readily parse and target related content. In other words, there is often a trade-off between complexity and either readability or targetability. As developers, we want to find the right balance between creating enough coherent structure to enhance readability and targetability without venturing into “divitis” territory.

Hopefully this quick video helps to explain this in-depth!

<span> has no physical appearance.
It is like the <p> tag in that it is intended for displaying text, but unlike it in that it does not start a new line. (in other words, it is inline)
<span> is mainly used to help you once you get to CSS so that you can style one part of a paragraph differently than the rest.
It is also used as an element that is only there to let you style the contents.
I hope that answers your question!

how do you use  in css? Do you have to attribute and İD or a class to the  tag?

Yeah, you’d probably use an element ID or class. You could target all  elements, but that probably would get more than what you’re wanting to target.

can you have a span within a span? How this is used?

71,How can I start writing my own HTML files?,"FAQ,HTML FAQ",,3,"
Question
In the context of this exercise, introducing HTML, how can I start writing my own HTML files?
Answer
You can write your own HTML files using a text editor, a code editor, or an integrated development environment (IDE).
One thing to keep in mind when writing and creating your own HTML files is that the file name must end with the extension .html, for example like index.html, in order to work.
Text editor
Some common text editors are Notepad on Windows, or TextEdit on MacOS.
Code editor
Code editors are usually preferred over text editors because they provide useful features like autocomplete and syntax coloring.
Some popular code editors are Sublime, Atom, and Notepad++.
Online Code editor
There are also online code editors available which let you share and edit your code, and even run your code in the browser.
These include JSFiddle, CodePen, and JS Bin.
Integrated Development Environments (IDE’s)
One useful function of IDE’s is that they can be used for testing and debugging your code.
Some IDE’s include Microsoft Visual Studio, Eclipse, and Adobe Dreamweaver.
","
Each webpage has a basic layout that is needed for a web browser (like Google Chrome) to display it correctly.
The webpage file needs to be saved with the extension “.html” to be able to open it in a web browser.
The first or home page is usually saved as index.html or sometimes default.html .
You can also create a text file (ex. index.txt) then rename it to index.html. (Remember to turn on ""View File Extensions if using Windows)
To edit this file and add content to your webpage, you can use any text editor like Notepad. Ones that are easier to use with HTML, CSS and JavaScript files are Notepad++ or Brackets. They change the colours of HTML tags and make the code easier to read. Both Notepad++ and Brackets have their own advantages, so try both to see which one you prefer.
An example of a layout for a basic webpage is as follows:
<!DOCTYPE html>

<html>
	<head>
		<title></title>
	</head>
	<body>
	
	</body>
</html>


The <!DOCTYPE> tag tells the browser which language the document is written in to interoperate and display it correctly. In this case the language is HTML5 or Hypertext Markup Language.
The <html> tags enclose the entirety of the html page content.
The <head> tags contain the metadata of the webpage, like the <title> which is the name displayed on the browser tab or when a bookmark is created.
The <body> tags contain all of the webpage content. This includes pictures, text and links.
Indenting your code like above makes it easier to read and follow. Use the Tab key to do this. Some text editors indent the code for you and some also add the closing tag (has the </>) automatically.

what is the difference between “code” editor and “text” editor? can you give some examples?

Question
Sectioning off the table headings doesn’t appear to change anything. Why does it “make sense to section off the table headings”?
Answer
While the <thead>, <tbody>, and <tfoot> (next exercise) tags may not affect the appearance of tables, they do create semantic meaning which can improve the user experience in a number of ways. For instance, with just a bit of CSS the <thead> tag allows developers to more readily target table headings and style them such that this information can be seen while scrolling through long tables.
What’s more, these semantic tags allow software like screen readers and search engines to make better sense of our table content.

73,"What's the connection between `input` and `datalist`, and do we need to specify `type`?","FAQ,HTML FAQ",forms,7,"
In the Learn section of this exercise it says:

The <datalist> is used with an <input type=""text""> element.

It seems that the logic to this is explained as being because this:

… creates a text field that users can type into and filter options from the <datalist>.

Indeed, in the example that’s then given, the <input> element includes this type=""text"" attribute, along with 3 other attributes, as follows:
<label for=""city"">Ideal city to visit?</label>
<input type=""text"" list=""cities"" id=""city"" name=""city"">

However, in the code given in this exercise’s code editor, the type=""text"" attribute is excluded altogether, as follows:
<label for=""sauce"">What type of sauce would you like?</label>
<input list=""sauces"" id=""sauce"" name=""sauce"">

The code seems to give the same result with or without type=""text"". Is it therefore optional, or even redundant?
Use of the type attribute when creating a datalist input is made even more confusing in exercise 14 - Forms Review, where it says:

Setting type to ""list"" will pair the <input> with a <datalist> element.

Am I right in thinking that this is actually wrong, because type is either set to ""text"" or excluded altogether? i.e. it can’t have a value of ""list"" because list is an attribute in its own right and set to the same ""value"" as the <datalist>'s id attribute? This is what is suggested by the code given to us in the code editor in exercises 12, 13 and 14, as follows:
<label for=""sauce"">What type of sauce would you like?</label>
<input list=""sauces"" id=""sauce"" name=""sauce"">
<datalist id=""sauces"">
  <option value=""ketchup""></option>
  <option value=""mayo""></option>
  <option value=""mustard""></option>
</datalist>

","
@jon_morris, I believe that you are correct, in that what you saw in the exercise 14 review:

Setting type to ""list"" will pair the <input> with a <datalist> element.

…is incorrect.
I’m not there yet, I’m on exercise 11, and it clearly says:

in the code above, we have an  <input>  that has a  list attribute. The  <input>  is associated to the  <datalist>  via the  <input> 's  list  attribute and the  id  of the  <datalist> .

I researched it a bit, and <list> is definitely not listed as a form <input> type per Mozilla’s documentation.
Mozilla’s docs may have also answered another of your questions (and one I was wondering too). Regarding the <input> tag’s <type> attribute:

If this attribute is not specified, the default type adopted is  text .

Maybe that’s why Codecademy didn’t include it, and why it still worked - the value defaulted to ‘text’.
When I get to the exercise 14 review, I’ll submit a bug to have it checked out, if it hasn’t already been done (for the setting the type=“list” reference).

Thanks for this @agentgenx! That helpfully confirms what I had assumed about list being a separate <input> attribute associated with the <datalist>'s id, and not a value of type.
And very good to know about the type default being ""text"", as that definitely clears up the confusion over its appearance then disappearance 
I didn’t submit an error report for the exercise 14 review, as I thought it was better to raise it as a query here first. So, now we’re certain, go ahead and do that yourself when you get there 

<input list=""sauces"" id=""sauce"" name=""sauce"">
<datalist id=""sauces"">

Why is the id for the datalist “sauces” and not the stated id of “sauce”, as was the case in the previous exercises? What role does id=sauce play here?

The way I understood it is as follows:
The label is linked to the input field via the value ""sauce"", which is assigned to the <label>'s for attribute and the <input>'s id attribute. This is the same method used with other previous input fields.
The <datalist> is then linked to the input field via the value ""sauces"", which is assigned to the <datalist>'s id attribute and the <input>'s list attribute.
<input> already has an id of ""sauce"" and from what I understand the same id value should only be assigned to one element, so <datalist> needs a different id. Using a plural creates a different id yet still indicates the relationship (although any other word could be used).
Also, notice that with the dropdown menu we don’t have this issue as, instead of an <input> element, we have a <select> element which is wrapped around all the fixed options (and creates the actual dropdown).
<select> is linked directly to the label without any need for an input field.
With the datalist, however, we have to accomodate for both a manual ‘free-choice’ input field and a list of pre-selected prompts. We do this by using <input> and <datalist> respectively.
There may be some deeper theory here, but I’m just a beginner. This is how I rationalised it - I hope it helps 

This was a very clear and helpful explanation! Until I get very comfortable with forms, I think I will continue to always include it.

In Microsoft Edge, it doesn’t show the text between the option tag. Only shows the value.

74,Do you have to use a seperate tag for Audio Source? Can you use it like an img tag?,"FAQ,HTML FAQ","semantic-html,q-a",7,"
Why do you have to use a separate  tag for audio? Is there a reason, why you can’t just add the src attribute directly to the audio tag, like you do with img: .
","
You don’t have to do it the way they showed it in the lesson, can can use the <audio> tag in the same way as the <video> tag.
Like:
<audio 
    controls 
    src=""/media/examples/t-rex-roar.mp3"">Your browser does not support the 
    <code>audio</code> element.
</audio>

One thing to take into account is that not all browsers support the same file types, so you might want to use multiple sources of different types of audio file, in that case, you will want to do it like they did it in the lesson:
<audio controls>
  <source src=""myAudio.mp3"" type=""audio/mpeg"">
  <source src=""myAudio.ogg"" type=""audio/ogg"">
  <p>Your browser doesn't support HTML5 audio. Here is
     a <a href=""myAudio.mp4"">link to the audio</a> instead.</p>
</audio>

Take a look at the example shown here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/audio#Attributes

If audio tag and video tag works well with a nested source tag, so it could work well in all media tags like img tag and so on?

I was also curious about which programming language is used to create browsers. Its more complicated than you’d think.
https://www.quora.com/What-programming-languages-are-web-browsers-like-Google-Chrome-Opera-and-Mozilla-Firefox-written-in

Because of its speed and universality, it’s likely that the bulk of code behind a browser will be written in C++, or some other low level derivative of the C language. The thing to keep in mind is that there are a variety of engines that handle HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Following the principles of white-spacing and indenting, if I needed to wrap multiple already written lines in a new tag/element, how do I add additional indentation to all those lines simultaneously?

This is very late, but for anyone who comes across this: You can indent multiple things by selecting everything you want to indent, and then press [Tab].
(this is also the reason i prefer always using [Tab] instead of [spacebar] for indenting)

That’s really helpful, thanks!

Great tip. I had the problem when I copied an example to my existing text but could not indent them to fit in at once. This tip is good.  Thanks.

Oh man…
What a helpful tip!!
Thanks

wow, exactly what I needed
thank you

Thanks for this awesome tip.

I discovered this today before we got to this question, mostly because I didn’t want to tab each row individually. By trial I selected all the rows and hit tab and Wahlah!

If you prefer using [spacebar] to indent your code rather than using [tab], you can select multiple lines by holding the [alt] key and clicking on the beginning of each line you want to indent. Then, you can press [spacebar] and all the selected lines will be affected.

Question
This exercise says that we will use what we learned in lesson 1 to create an HTML document in lesson 2. Weren’t we already creating HTML documents in this lesson?
Answer
Not quite. This lesson focused on some common elements developers use within the <body> tag. The content of the <body> tag will display on a page but, as you will learn in lesson 2, HTML documents also have a document type declaration and metadata which is not displayed on the page.
","
While we might have been creating an HTML doc in lesson one it was not a one with a great semantic structure. Reviewing the Video at the end of lesson 1 called HTML Structure made me wonder why we were taught to use the “div” tag at all.  In the video, the narrator “cleans” up a bunch a code that suffers from divitis replacing all the existing “div” tags with others like “section”, “nav” and “small”.  She shows why she did this by using the “tree” structure and comparing a before and after graphics of the information architecture and the difference between a semantically thoughtful doc and a semantically meaningful one. Apparently, with the advent of HTML 5 we can now semantically meaningful tree structures. It made so much more sense to see the content grouped like this. PLUS she had a tool to clean up the indentation of the code which answered another question that I had about the structure of the indentations. I was not clear as to whether you could indent an indent.  The video showed that yes, you can do that to a number of levels. Thanks for creating this video, CodeAcademy, as it helped to clarify a number of issues…

81,Why is textarea seperate from input? Is it even necessary?,"FAQ,HTML FAQ","forms,q-a",12,"
Why are input type=“text” and textarea elements separate at all? As they are both text input boxes, wouldn’t the textarea element just be a styled input type=“text”? Or is there another difference I’m not aware of yet?
","
In HTML5, the default type is text so we don’t need to declare a type if it is going to be text. Were we required to set this, then it would have to be applied to both input and textarea.elements.
Not sure I caught the complete gist of your question, so spur me along if this is not the answer you were looking for.

Thanks for your reply. I’m more wondering why the INPUT with type=text and TEXTAREA elements are separated at all, if TEXTAREA is only a larger version of INPUT type=text? Wouldn’t that be a styling difference, to be done in CSS, rather than a functional difference in HTML? Is there a functional difference between these 2 elements that I’m not realizing?

TEXTAREA allows line breaks, INPUT does not (I believe; correct me if I’m wrong).
As for the type, I’m not even sure we can declare a different type than ‘text’, or even need to in the older iterations of HTML. It’s defined as a text area.
Ideally, we squeeze as much functionality out of our HTML as possible, before introducing styles; and, we squeeze as much behavior out of our CSS as possible before introducing JavaScript.
When inputs are expected to be bits of data, then <input> and when expecting prose, <textarea>. HTML5 added a significant number of types to the input element. Be sure to look up these elements at w3.org or MDN.

Got it. Line breaks are the difference in functionality I wasn’t realizing, but do now. Thanks!
Other than ‘text’ as type options in an input tag, there are: ‘number’, ‘range’, ‘checkbox’, ‘radio’, etc… Then you have input lists and datalists, too.

Hi
When the textarea tag is closed inline (like this <textarea … />), the textarea contains html until the end of the document 
Strange.

Screenshot_20191123_110906.png1874×1206 341 KB


TEXTAREA is not a void element, but a container for textual data.
<textarea>

</textarea>

Hi, In order to give the default value to the textarea, we need to write the text in between the opening and closing tag, Why don’t we have a value attribute to add the default value just like we had in the input tag?
<input type=""text"" name=""textbox"" id=""textbox"" value=""Enter a value"">

i find writing text between opening and closing tag of textarea more logical. I mean, you do the same for paragraph, span and many other elements
input is actually the odd one out, given <input> is self-closing, you can’t type text between the opening and closing tag, thus we need an attribute

oh Okay, makes sense. Thanks !

Why is it that the default value in the <textarea> element cannot be put in the “value” attribute like the <input> element?

Hello,
I can not display the video, in error message it says I did not create a suitcase , here is my code below:  

<video src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/courses/freelance-1/unit-1/lesson-2/htmlcss1-vid_brown-bear.mp4"">

That would be the correct way, you’re putting the source of the video in the content section, which is wrong.

Can I use one or more <source> tags inside the <video> element?

Hey there!
I tried testing the alternative text for the  tag by taking a letter out of the link. Instead of replacing the video window with the text “Video not supported”, the video window is dark grey and gives no error code.

The instructions for the exercise say to wrap the video url in: .  The trouble is, the “>” in the opening tag seems to be an error?  The video won’t load with the tag typed as instructed: 
Only by leaving OFF that second > does it load the video.  So the correct instruction would have been for the opening tag to be written: <video          (correct?)
If so, it would appear that there is an error in the directions.

In part 15 of the HTML tutorial (Elements and Structures) no matter how I try to do it I can’t get the video to work.

How can we determine the size width and height of a video using <video> tags in html5? What size is considered to be a good size for a video?




 cloudjumper11171:

What size is considered to be a good size for a video?


The smaller the file, the faster it downloads, but we need to also consider full screen and HD. Ideally, 480p will be quick to download, while 720p, though slower to download will offer better resolution and image quality.
The content of the video will dictate over what level of quality to consider using at the upper end.
If you open YouTube the base size for videos is a good default.

85,Do tags themselves count as content?,"FAQ,HTML FAQ",q-a,7,"
Question
In this example, do the <p> tags also count as content or is the content just the sentence contained within the tags?
Answer
The content is just the information contained within the tags themselves. The tags are marking up this content so that the browser knows how to properly interpret and structure this information. As you will learn later in this lesson, the content is not always contained within an opening and closing tag. For example, the <img> tag is an example of a self-closing tag and it introduces content into the page differently than the <p> element.

should be than not then

Thank you for pointing that out. Fixed.

can someone tell me if this is right so the < p > element can only contain text or can it contain images too? and also it said it the last question that tags like images can’t contain content at all is this because after you finish your content you use the < IMG > to finish the content off? thanks guys in advance




 matty1994:

or can it contain images too?


A paragraph may contain any inline level element. B, I, STRONG, EM, SPAN, INPUT, BR, HR and IMG are among such elements. (Check up on BR and HR as to whether block or inline.)
In the old days we used to have an unwritten rule… “No inline elements in the BODY.” That means an IMG would necessarily be contained in either a DIV, an LI or a P. I still recommend containing images, even if this rule is flouted in present day.
An IMG element is known as a void element since it is not a content container. It’s content is written to attributes on the element. For IMG, this would be the src, title and alt attributes.

so does that mean that <body></body> is not the content of <html></html>?

No. BODY is a child of HTML. All the content the user sees is contained in it.

86,What sorts of things can child elements inherit from their parents?,"FAQ,HTML FAQ",q-a,5,"
Question
This exercise says that child elements can inherit from their parents. What sorts of things can child elements inherit from their parents?
Answer
When you dive into our CSS course you will learn that child elements inherit most of their styling from their parent elements. In other words, most styles cascade down from parents to children.
","
I understand about the styling part, but what about the behavior that is mentioned in the lesson ?

Moreover, the relationship parent, child, and sibling is important to manipulate
HTML elements via Javascript language. For example, If you understand that the parent of this list of items is ul element, you can add one more item within it when a user clicks a button on your web page.
<ul>
  <li>Walk my dog</li>
  <li>Buy some milk</li>
  <li>Finish math homework</li>
</ul>

Please keep learning HTML and CSS. They are very important. Then, you can adventure to Javascript.

Sticking to this family illustation, if childen elements inherit from their parents, can they also inherit from grandparent elements, like children can inherit from their grandparents in real life? 

yes. The vocabulary is just to demonstrate the path of cascading. Make sure to understand which attributes will take precedence.

Question
I added <body> to my page as instructed in this exercise but I am not passing step one. Why?
Answer
Be sure to create both an opening tag (<body>) and a closing tag (</body>) for this element. Take another careful look at the code snippet on display in this lesson. Notice how both the opening and closing body tags are nested within the html tags? Notice how indentation is being used here? You are going to want to follow suit.
","
would an opening tag (<p>) and a closing tag (</p) be always be display this way and why? …why is it says <body>  when its really<p>?

The BODY element is the outermost container of the content portion of the document. The P element is content nested in the body, as it should be. A valid HTML document has only one BODY, but has no limit on content.
<body>
  <p>This is page content (a paragraph) nested in the BODY element.</p>
</body>

Thanks! I finally understood this once I moved along the lesson 

What is the standard indentation for nesting? In this case for the  p tag under the body tag?




 nviulet:

standard indentation for nesting


Because there is a lot of nesting in typical HTML document, the accepted standard is two spaces per level.
<body>
  <div>
    <hi></h1>
    <div>
      <p></p>
      <p></p>
      <p></p>
    </div>
  </div>
</body>


It still wont work for me.  What am I doing wrong?

Link to lesson, please, as well, post your HTML so we can test it.

Hi, why do we have to use both opening and closing tags, < body>,</ body>,< p> and </ p>, for displaying content? I tried it without the body tags and the content still displays on the webpage. What’s the difference between the two tags?

This question goes against the grain of well-formedness in documents facing the web. There are some rare instances where closing tags are not mandatory, but on the whole, our documents should follow strict guidelines and use closing tags where expected.
Take for instance list items and paragraphs.
<section>
  <ul>
    <li>list item
    <li>list item
    <li>list item
    <li>list item
  </ul>
</section>

List items are easy to separate using only the OPENTAG, but in the above, the </ul> and </section> ENDTAGs must be present or the document will not validate. LIkewise,
<section>
  <h1>heading</h1>
  <p>Lorem ipsum
  <p>Lorem ipsum
  <p>Lorem ipsum
  <p>Lorem ipsum
</section>

paragraphs are also easily distinguished by their OPENTAG. Again, the </h1> and </section> ENDTAGs are required or the document will not validate.
Loose paragraphs and list items may be okay, but in the fast changing world we should never take for granted that every user agent will be forgiving of missing endtags. If the spec calls for it, then use it, without question and you will get less surprises in future.

A post was split to a new topic: Why no error?

My problem: Not the   code itself, but the fact that I had not pressed “Run” yet.

If given enough time to time-out, the lesson auto-runs when we resume coding. That is a big time fly in the ointment as many members will contend, and one we have long been requesting would be rectified.
Reset the lesson, and do it again would be my advice.

A valid HTML document has only one BODY, but has no limit on content.
Ref to your above message , I am revising this course (doing it all over again) and closer to the end I do recollect noticing how more than 1 BODY are created in a single HTML document with the intent to separate long codes- or rather break down long complicated data
Please do clarify on this


https://dev.w3.org/html5/html-author/#the-body-element
4.3.4.1 The body element
The body element represents the main content of the document.
Start tag:    optional
End tag:    optional
Categories: 	    Sectioning root.
Contained By: 	    As the second element in an html element.
Content Model: 	    Flow content.

The operative term is bolded. There is no second, ‘second element’.
That stipulation aside, it is possible to have two body elements if there are two html elements. This is done in an <iframe></iframe> element. Use the link above to search the site for that element and see how an html document can contain another html document.
The learning environment of the main CC site is a perfect example of this. Our webpage (the one we see) is actually embedded in another webpage, the one with a single URL.

88,Do absolute paths always point to remote files or assets?,"FAQ,HTML FAQ",elements-structure,3,"
Question
Do absolute paths always point to remote files or assets?
Answer
No. Absolute paths may also be used to point to local files or assets. However, when linking to local files it generally makes more sense to store files or assets within the project directory itself and then use a relative path to point to it. To learn more about paths, check out this StackExchange thread.

89,Isn't font size more presentation than structure?,"FAQ,HTML FAQ",q-a,5,"
Question
I thought that CSS controlled the presentation of a page but it looks like heading elements have different sizes. Isn’t font size more presentation than structure?
Answer
Good observation! You are correct in that font size is a presentational aspect of a page and CSS defines how our pages look. The font size of the text contained within a heading element is controlled by the browser’s default style sheet. Developers can overwrite this default style sheet by creating their own custom style sheets. To learn more about style sheets, check out the Learn CSS course.
","
Sure, defining text as headings changes the size, but that’s besides the point (you can always change it with CSS). It’s really telling the browser what kind of content it is, which is super important for SEO.




 crysespaillat:

which is super important for SEO


… or any user agent that analyzes the document outline. When only the default style sheet is taken into account, headings and lists present in ways that user agents expect. Headings are displayed in smaller text the lower their rank in the heirarchy. Lists display with bullets.
We do not choose a heading element just for its size but for how important it is to the overall scope of the document.
h1  =>  top level heading, title of document

h2  =>  secondary level heading for document sections (topics)

h3  =>  tertiary level heading for topic sections

As we can see, the scope of the heading is more localized and constrained the further we drill into the document. Headings and lists are semantic elements at their very core.

Using correct heading structure is also extremely important for making sure your website/UI is accessible (i.e. can be used by people with disabilities and their assistive technologies). A lot of screen reader users will navigate a page by using a shortcut that will let them simply travel between headings. If the page doesn’t use headings correctly, this feature is basically useless.

Thank you for sharing this point. I did not know heading structure affected screen readers.

90,"What does ""document type"" mean?","FAQ,HTML FAQ","elements-structure,q-a",8,"
what does document type means?
","
Document type means you are telling to the browser what type of document you are submitting to the browser.Reason for using document type in the beginning of the hmtl script is while running that script in the browser it will understand that it is an html document,so the browser will arrange the document in hmtl formate and run rest of the script properly and the it gives output.

Document type is simply telling the computer what file this is. This can be html file, text file, php file and so on.

The Document Type states what type of code you are using. EX.
<!DOCTYPE html>

Shows that you are using HTML5

Think of it as two people who know multiple languages and want to begin a conversation. First, they must agree on what language to communicate in. Identifying html as the DOCTYPE is declaring the language that is about to be spoken is html.

I’m a total beginner, but I think of it as telling the OS which language the code is written in so that it can interpret and present it correctly.  Just hope I’m right in thinking that way.

telling the computer? Or telling the browser?
Browsers were implemented to read html documents(html can be written in previous versions of html eg html4,3,2 or even 1 ) but you always have to specify what html you are writing, inside the html document!

The OS? We are talking about browsers. Operating Systems are a whole other thing.

91,Are there differences between `name` and `id`?,"FAQ,HTML FAQ","forms,q-a",12,"
Are the “name” and “id” always the same? what is an example of when we would need them to be different?
","
Hello and welcome on the site 
They can be different, Id is to identify the element in CSS or in JS, name is to identify element in HTML and in PHP for form handling
Hope this helps 

This question has been asked many times in this HTML Forms unit, and the best answer I’ve seen so far is this: FAQ: Learn HTML: Forms - Adding a Label

I’ve noticed that the instructions mention name but not id, however to pass the code you need to have both.

Use name attributes for form controls, as that’s the identifier used in the POST or GET call that happens on form submission.
Use id attributes whenever you need to address a particular HTML element with CSS, JavaScript or a fragment identifier.
It’s possible to look up elements by name too, but it’s simpler and more reliable to look them up by ID.
Name is used for form handling in PHP when a form is submitted via HTML, name doesn’t have to be unique on a page, as it can link other elements together.
Hope this helps 

I still don’t get it.
Why is the id attribute to identify the element in CSS/JS even though in the lesson whe saw that it’s related to the attribute “for” in the label element (which is html language or I am wrong?)?
Sorry for my bad english!

Id is used in CSS and in JS as you said:
document.getElementById(""someId"") // javascript

#someId {
  color: green; /* CSS */
}

For is used for labeling as you said, and name too.
But beacuse Id-s are unique it’s easier to handle them in JavaScript.
So that name’s aren’t unique they return an array even if there is only one name, just like classes:
document.getElementsByName(""someName"") // Names

document.getElementsByClassName(""someClass"") // Classes

As I said they return an array so we target one of them with:
document.getElementsByName(""someName"")[0] // Names

document.getElementsByClassName(""someClass"")[0] // Classes

We can even target all of them (or some of them) with a for loop:
for (let i = 0; i < document.getElementsByClassName.length; i++) {
  document.getElementsByClassName[i].style.color = ""green"";
}

And we use names to work with forms in PHP.
Hope this helps 

Hello,
Just wondering if “name” and “id” must be passed to the same string. Can anyone help with this?

They’ve answered that question before. You can and is often see it on big companies as the moderator said in another FAQ.

Is there a way where Codecademy forum hightlights the code depending on the language?
For example python print(""Hello World"")
I don’t know I would like to have some colors in the text to differentiate the languages like Discord does.

Basically an ID isn’t going to have an effect on your actual html but it serves as a variable name in your CSS and Javascript, meanwhile a name is going to be the variable name to use in your html.

It makes sense, thank you

93,How can we make transparent text that disappears when replaced?,"FAQ,HTML FAQ","forms,q-a",23,"
i think that the textarea element in exercise: “LEARN HTML: FORMS - Textarea element” would be better suited to use placeholder text rather than text that the user has to delete before they can type. It makes the form have better usability and user experience.
it would look like this:
<textarea id=""extra"" name=""extra"" rows=""3"" cols=""40"" placeholder=""Special Instructons...""></textarea>

","
In a backward compatible world, especially screen readers, placeholder attribute may not be supported, hence the legacy use of value text. The aim is the same, though… To indicate the type of content expected in the field. The specifications as they are currently defined still stipulate this.

placeholder
A hint to the user of what can be entered in the control. Carriage returns or line-feeds within the placeholder text must be treated as line breaks when rendering the hint.

Note: Placeholders should only be used to show an example of the type of data that should be entered into a form; they are not a substitute for a proper  <label>  element tied to the input. See Labels and placeholders in : The Input (Form Input) element for a full explanation.



https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/textarea


Is it possible to make the default text disappear when clicked on the textarea field on the page by the user.

For that, the placeholder attribute exist:
<textarea placeholder=""some value""></textarea>


What is an example of when I may want to set a default text in the  element? I see that it does not go away when someone starts typing.  Thank you.

When an input field is more commonly than not given a specific string, we can assume it is the consensus, at which point by learning from our users we can make that input a default.
If our audience is from the Greater Toronto Area we might supply Maple Leafs to the question, “Which team do you want to win the Stanley Cup?” The user need only click Okay or press Enter.
If we cannot justify a default value, then we should use a placeholder to suggest or advise, and not give a value.
<label>Which team do you want to win the Stanley Cup? 
<input value=""Maple Leafs"" name=""stanley-cup-hopeful"">
</label>

<label for=""name"">Name: </label>
<input id=""name"" name=""name"" placeholder=""Type your name"">

Yes, thank you! I was looking for this.

In instruction 2, we can put in default text.
Can we possibly put in transparent text that you can write over?

Have you tried the placeholder attribute in a <textarea> element?

Oh ok, I saw this at the end of the lesson. Thank you!

Yes.  <textarea id=""extra"" name=""extra"" rows=""3"" cols=""40"" placeholder=""Your opinion is valuable to us.""></textarea>. But the output with and without the placeholder attribute remains the same in the text field nothing is displayed .

The text node of <textarea> </textarea> is the placeholder.
                      ^
                      |
                  text node

yes.but then the user has to erase the pre-filled text to write his/her comments…is there any way that as soon as the user clicks on the text field and the pre-filled text goes away?like we do in <input type=""text"">

The text should be selected when the field gets focus. The user can start typing to overwrite it.
Another approach would be to use a label, or a fieldset with legend.




 mtf:

The text should be selected when the field gets focus.


which tag or attribute should  I use to do this?

<label for=""comment"">Enter your comments below</label>
<textarea id=""comment"" name=""comment"" ...>

</textarea>


Thanks a lot…that really helped


is this how it should look like? or is it a problem with my connection?!

Opinions may vary… I’m not fond of any text prestaged in the TEXTAREA, especially when given an instructive LABEL.

I agree. If the label is detailed enough then placeholder becomes obsolete. I guess it would just make the code a little more needlessly complex.

94,How long or detailed should our alternative text be?,"FAQ,HTML FAQ",,4,"
Question
How long or detailed should our alternative text be?
Answer
Alt attributes should be accurate and as sufficient as possible. Usually, a few words will be descriptive enough but occasionally a sentence or two will be more appropriate.
For more information on how to create great alternative text, take a look at these examples.
","
Does it always have to be double quotes when we are writing anything inside a tag, can we use single quotes as well?

The general practice is double quotes when we hand write the code, but when generating code the circumstances will dictate. Personally, I always use double quotes on attributes and generate HTML strings with single quotes.
'<div class=""something"">content</div>'

or,
`<div class=""${classname}"">${content}</div>`

Double quote is recommended, because we use single quote as punctuation when writing English sentences as well. That will end your quote unexpectedly.
For example ‘It’s a Brown Bear!’ as opposed to “It’s a Brown Bear!”. I the first sentence your HTML quote will end with just ‘It’, because it got confused.

If you are getting an error in your CSS code check:

Is your CSS linked correctly to your HTML ?
<link type=""text/stylesheet"" rel=""stylesheet"" href=""stylesheet.css"">

Is your element closed ?                  SEE  

Are you targeting the correct selector ?
Is the spelling correct ?
Check and make sure!


If you are getting an error in HTML code check:
* Are all your tags closed? Most HTML elements require both an opening and a closing tag:
 ` ` :arrow_left:   `open`  |  `close`   :arrow_right: ``
* Your tags should be  lowercase 
`` uppercase p ``  :negative_squared_cross_mark:
`` lowercase p `` :white_check_mark:
`` mixed upper&lowercase ``  :negative_squared_cross_mark:
        
Font size issues
It could be either of the two:
If your error is: Did you give your paragraph a font-size of 26px [or any other size]? It looks like it's currently 16px. then your issue will be your browser’s zoom. Make sure you’re not accidentally zoomed in/out? Use ctrl+0 (PC) or cmd+0 (Mac) to reset.
If your error is: it looks like your code is 12px instead of 10px then the issue is your browser’s minimum font size - click here to find out how change that.

96,Is it possible to style the error message?,"FAQ,HTML FAQ","forms,q-a",8,"
Where does the error message come from and is it possible to style it? I looked through the other files but can’t figure this out.
For example, if I type 0 and click submit it says: “Value must be greater than or equal to 1”. Say you wanted to change the message ( for example, “Enter a number between 1 and 10”) or style it with css. Is that possible in this case?
","
Anything in the DOM can be given CSS properties of our liking, so yes, the message can be styled. Chances are the error messages are written in the HTML but hidden from view (with, display: none;). Dig through the HMTL and CSS and find the id or class attribute given to the element(s).

MDN documentation says you can change the message with JavaScript: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Forms/Form_validation#Customized_error_messages
Not sure you can change the style (font, color, margin etc.), though.

I now know how to style the error message with JavaScript. See this article from CSS Tricks:

##Why doesn’t my title appear in Codecademy’s preview ?
This question arises many times so here’s the answer:
The title tag adds the title to your browsers tab  

Why can’t we see the title on Codecademy ?

Codecademy uses something called an iframe, preventing the title from showing up in the browser tab where it should. You could try it on jsbin, which allows your title beside theirs. Even better would be a local html file - @stetim94
Just to clarify this is the title tag

99,This exercise says that <!DOCTYPE html> “specifies the version of HTML for the browser”. What are the different versions of HTML and why do they exist?,"FAQ,HTML FAQ",q-a,14,"
Question
This exercise says that  “specifies the version of HTML for the browser”. What are the different versions of HTML and why do they exist?
Answer
These days most web developers use HTML5 but pre-HTML5 some common doctypes included HTML 4.01 Strict, HTML 4.01 Transitional, XHTML 1.0 Strict, and XHTML 1.0 Transitional. For example, the HTML 4.01 Strict doctype look like this:
A strict doctype validates differently than the more permissive transitional doctype.
","
So if you type <!DOCTYPE html> the computer automatically knows that the html you are talking about is html5 or would you have to change the tag to <!DOCTYPE html5>???

<!DOCTYPE html> is the doctype declaration for html5, then the browser will understand it can expect a html document which uses html5 standards
<!DOCTYPE html5> is non-existing, don’t use it

The <! DOCTYPE> element is used to specify the type of the current document - the DTD (document type definition). This is necessary for the browser to understand how to interpret the current web page, since HTML exists in several versions, in addition, there is XHTML (EXtensible HyperText Markup Language), similar to HTML, but different in syntax. To the browser “did not get confused” and understood, according to what standard to display a web page and it is necessary to specify <! DOCTYPE> in the first line of the code.
Previously, the index file needed to write large lines like
<! DOCTYPE html PUBLIC"" - // W3C // DTD XHTML 1.1 // EN “” http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml11/DTD/xhtml11. dtd "">
Fortunately, with the advent of HTML5, everything became much simpler and the first line became significantly shorter: <! DOCTYPE html>

To a computer, <!DOCTYPE html> = HTML5

When you type  the    The computer basically knows you want what’s best which is the latest html. The latest in this case being html5, the computer will automatically use  html5

So in the future if a new version of html becomes the standard rather than html5, will simply typing  indicate using that latest version? And if so, will you then have to specify html5 by using ?

its difficult to say what w3c will do, only time will tell. But those guys know what they are doing, so surely they will do something sensible.




 lexiwoodworth1210444:

will simply typing indicate using that latest version?


HTML5 is the current Living Standard. As the post above reads, the user agent will always implement the latest recommendations. We will never have to specify HTML5, as it will always be able to run in any newer browser. HTML in its newest form is for the most part fully backward compatible.
Technically, when served as the default text/html it validates to HTML 4.01 specs, save for the new bits.



 fazedimonds704749663:

The computer basically knows you want what’s best


To clarify, not the computer… The browser. We should always keep our browser(s) up to date so the latest recommendations are available.

The other DOCTYPEs for the various versions are:
HTML

HTML 4.01 transitional

HTML 4.01 strict

HTML 4.01 frameset

HTML 3.2

XHTML

XHTML 1.0 transitional

XHTML 1.0 strict

XHTML 1.0 Frameset

XHTML 2.0


Personally I find the notation of !DOCTYPE html a bit contradictary. Most programming languages (that I know of) use the exclamation mark (""!"") to state when something IS NOT.
!DOCTYPE html
From my (slightly inexperienced view) it means that the DOCTYPE IS NOT html…

I agree with you but that’s from a different point of view, I bet you’ve been working with java script or something like that but in html, the [!] is to specify something, in this case, the type of HTML you want to use, being HTML 5 because it is currently the latest




 fazedimonds704749663:

in html, the [!] is to specify something,


The exclamation mark in SGML is a comment, or part of it. The document type decaration is outside of the HTML, so not HTML at all. It is SGML.
Markup is not a programming language, but a declarative one. It has no logic, only declarations.
<!-- an HTML comment -->


Thanks for clarifying, I too have a lot to learn

I understand the forms and different types of input but i’m assuming the page after you press the submit button is another landing page. I just wanted to confirm is this the code that would take the visitor there ?
","
You can set the action attribute on the form element:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form#attr-action
which could be many things, usually its a request to the server, which then processes the form, and sends back a response (often a page)

In this exercise the <form> element has its action attribute set to ""submission.html"" as follows:
<form action=""submission.html"" method=""POST"">

From what I can see, the file submission.html only contains code to generate the page Thanks for your submission! (the response generated on clicking the form’s submit button). However, my understanding from exercise 2 - How a Form Works and exercise 14 - Forms Review is that the action attribute determines where the information collected in the form is sent when it’s submitted i.e. where the name=""value"" pairs end up being stored for further processing by the end user.
Are we not seeing any code in submission.html for the transfer of these name=""value"" pairs, because this is just an example and the form’s information is not actually being processed and transferred somewhere else? What would we see in actual practice? Would there be additional code triggered by the action attribute’s ""value"", which together with the method=""POST"" attribute would cause the form to be processed and its data transferred (in addition to the response page being displayed to the person who completed and submitted the form)?
Or am I misunderstanding something? 




 jon_morris:

Are we not seeing any code in submission.html for the transfer of these name=""value"" pairs, because this is just an example


yes



 jon_morris:

What would we see in actual practice?


a back-end, where we actually process the information. This could be a lot of different things.
The login you use at many websites? That is a form, so in that case, the back-end has to validate your credentials and authenticate you.
The box i am currently typing my reply in could be a form with a text-area, which would need to be saved to the database.



 jon_morris:

Would there be additional code triggered by the action attribute’s ""value"" , which together with the method=""POST"" attribute would cause the form to be processed


yes, often in the back-end. Here is a nice image to demonstrate the process:
 




Very helpful diagram! 
So, where in this exercise we see the action attribute directly redirecting the browser to the “success” page (generated by the code in submission.html), in practice it is more likely to have a ""value"" which references to a different back-end file containing code for the first back-end process (e.g. validating the data).
Is that correct?
I’m sure we’ll learn about this in more detail in later courses, so sorry if I’m jumping the gun a bit. It’s just nice to get a broad idea early on of how this works in practice, as it helps conceptualise things more easily. 

just make sure that if you jump in the deep end, that you don’t drown. Having warned for that, i think its actually a positive thing you are curious about this and ask questions



 jon_morris:

Is that correct?


yea, you are correct. action can also point to a url (example.com/login for example).
lets do a very silly PHP example (PHP is a back-end language, which could run on your server), lets say we have:
<form method=""POST"" action=""submission.php"">
   <input type=""text"" name=""username"">
   <input type=""submit"" value=""submit username"">
</form>

html will send use the data entered based on the name attribute of the input field. So then in submission.php we can do:
$username = $_POST['username'] 
# now we could write the username to a file
# although often a database is used

we could this for every field. Thankfully, abstraction exist to simplify this process, but this is the basic. There are also many languages capable of doing this (java, c#, python, ruby, go, javascript (nodeJS) to name a few)

I think it is a great excercise BUT, I dont see explained what happens when someone clicks on Submit button?

The form would go to https://codecademy.com/example.html` in this case. Forms are very often send to the domain (website) where they where coming from. So codecademy rendered the page with the form, so the submitted form also goes codecademy website

However, I was wondering after learning how to create submit buttons what code are we supposed to use to gather and store the information received once users have already provided the input information? I hope that my question makes sense! I would greatly appreciate anyone’s help!




 coogu:

what code are we supposed to use to gather and store the information received once users have already provided the input information?


this can be interpreted two ways: keep the input fields populated after invalid form submission or how to retrieve stored information
this won’t be covered within the html course, given this involves a database (mysql for example) and a programming language to validate, store and retrieve the information (c#, java, python, ruby, golang to name a few)

Ok gotcha. Thanks I appreciate your response!

Can I see what I have submitted? Or to ask differently: If I made a website with <form>, how could I see what the reader submited?

normally you would send the form back to your server/back-end where you can validate and store the data.

I’m guessing with another programming language? Or HTML again?

you can set the action attribute on the form element, this will point to the forum endpoint, but yes, the back-end requires the use of other languages
if you are just curious, you could also just use JS to see the form:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54512053/how-to-console-log-the-entire-html-form

Great explanation 

So to follow up that question - when the request is sent to the server - u would need corresponding code in your js file or does your html communicate to the server via the browser directly? and via http command transfer the data from the form in a json?

102,Can we nest any element within `<a>` tags? (li elements?),"FAQ,HTML FAQ",q-a,10,"
Question
In this exercise we nested an <img> element within an <a> element to make images  clickable links. Can we nest any element within <a> tags? (li elements?)
Answer
With HTML5, the <a> tag can now contain both inline and block-level elements. For example, we can nest heading elements within <a> tags like so:
<a href=”#”><h1>Example</h1> </a>

This would make the entire <h1> element clickable!
That having been said, one block-level tag which we do not want to nest within an <a> tag is the <li> tag. <li> tags should always be direct children to either <ol> , <ul>, or the experimental <menu> tags.
To learn more about inline and block-level elements, check out our “Learn CSS” course.
","
Why can’t I see ‘Example’ in this answer?

Because the markup wasn’t right, you should be able to see it now.

I still cant see the example working out, it has the icon of a broken image




 wiki-bot:

<a href=”#”><h1>Example</h1> </a>


From the basic definition of an anchor, it is an inline element, not a container for other block level elements. This example is blatantly incorrect and (without yet testing) surely to raise some warnings from a validator.
<h1><a>Example</a></h1>

is more semantically clear. The inline element is contained by the block element. That makes sense.
An OL and UL parent element can only have LI as direct children. We would never wrap an LI in a link. The link would go inside that block level element.
<ul>
<li><a>link</a></li>
<li><a>link</a></li>
<li><a>link</a></li>
</ul>

It’s not a surprise that we might see,
<a><div></div></a>

Browsers are very forgiving and try their best to render something. The A in this example might even take the dimensions and position of the DIV, but it still goes against the grain. Inline elements should not be used to contain block level elements. It traces back to semantics and document outline.
It should be noted that IMG is an inline element.

Now as we’ve seen in terms of anchors, above, the same would apply to inline elements without a parent container. That is, inline elements floating in a sea of block elements. This is a rendering issue waiting to happen.
Inline elements need to be contained. Block level elements ARE containers. At the very minimum, images should be contained by a DIV, but a P (paragraph) is even better.
HTML5 gives us the FIGURE element which when studied will reveal so much of what early developers had to grapple with in terms of WCAG and SEO.






 mtf:

 link link link 


But It works perfectly in modern browsers like crome, firefox…

Pretty much anything goes in HTML. The browser will never raise an exception or even complain. That’s why the specifications are recommendations, not syntax rules.
HTML development is designed around document structure and the outline. Validators look for well-formedness. Accessibility testing looks for roughly the same thing, only along a stricter line. Don’t be surprised that anything one tries will work. Is it well formed, though? That’s the question a responsible developer will ask.

for associates a label with an input element. This is needed for people who use disability tools.
name is used to associate the input field with the data send to the server.

is it not bad practice to store a password as plain text? Is their a better way to encrypt it?




 magicmaster125:

is it not bad practice to store a password as plain text?


absolutely, storing passwords as plain text is a horrible idea. But in this lesson we are not storing passwords? We merely make an input field to enter the password
If you would actually submit the form, your website should use HTTPS to securely communicate with the server, where the password should be hashed and stored (register), or be hashed and compared with the hashed stored version (login)

why don’t we use the value attribute in the input set to value=""""?

If that is the value you desire of the input field, then you should. Without more context its difficult to answer the question 

I noticed that we did not use the value attribute in the input in the example below. so i was wondering why was that?
<form>
  <label for=""user-password"">Password: </label>
  <input type=""password"" id=""user-password"" name=""user-password"">
</form>

this is the example we did in the password chapter of forms

Why would you want to give a default value to a password input field? The user should just be able to enter their password

Or we can leave the value attribute blank like value="" "" and use a placeholder=""Password"" attribute instead to give users a sense of what are they supposed to enter. In one of the previous lessons i saw that it was mentioned to use value attribute as its value becomes whatever you type in the text-field,  and is paired with the name attribute to be sent as a text to the destination file.

your value attribute isn’t blank? It contains a white-space. If you leave it blank, the value attribute can be omitted altogether. The value attribute is useful when we want to have a default value
placeholder or a label, or both. Yea, that is possible. If you pay attention to it while visiting different websites, you will see different strategies are used.

Ya i just saw that it contains a white space, thanks for pointing that out!
If we leave it blank, then it can be omitted, but then what about the data that will be sent from the text field. What will it be paired with? I am having confusion with just the pairing of name and value attribute. Do they need to be paired or we can do just fine without pairing?

under the hood, the value is kept track of. The value attribute is useful when we want to overwrite the default value of the input field.

Oh now i get it! Thanks!!  

This all makes sense now.

Why would you want to assigne certain values to the ‘value’ attribute of the checkboxes, if these are not visible on the form itself? Why the use of the ‘value’ attribute here? I thought this was used to pre-fill the form?

 stephaniewimber:

Why would you want to assigne certain values to the ‘value’ attribute of the checkboxes, if these are not visible on the form itself?


They are visible in the LABEL. The value is what gets POSTed (when the form is submitted) with the name in the name attribute as its variable…
[name] = [checked value]

I thought the reason why we put the “id” and “for” attributes is to make the label show. why do we have to put value attributes?

As shown above, we only use for if the label does not wrap the input control.



 cloudsurfer00443:

why do we have to put value attributes?


Because that attribute receives the user input. When the form is Submitted, the POST data is assembled as a name-value pair.
<input name=""choice"" value=""user input"">

goes to the POST data as,
choice = ""user input""

In our example we assigned “topping” to be the value of all three name-attributes in our checkboxes.
If I understand it correctly by checking a box the defined value (for example “tomato”) will become the value of my variable “topping”?
Lets say I choose all checkboxes. Will now alle values (e.g. “tomato”, “lettuce”) be attached as one string to the variable “topping”?

Checkboxes permit one or more selections. Any that are checked will be passed along in the POSTDATA.

So, if I check many or all items, does that mean that [name]=[value1, value2,…]?

Yes, although I’m not sure if it is in an array, or just a comma separated list. Something to look into.

And why do we not always need the value attribute for text or number types?

We only need it if is has a preset value. It may also be written as an empty string (value=""""). The input from the user will create the attribute if it is not present in the markup.


What are the differences and characteristics of the “id”, “name” and “value” attributes?
Are both “id” and “name” attributes mandatory for the form tag/element or can we use either of them along with a label tag?




id is the DOM identifier of the element, and it has no bearing on the POSTDATA (submitted form data).

name is a required attribute if the form is being submitted, or for such elements as radio buttons to signify the choice range. It is rarely ever used as a DOM reference.

value is the data object, either the user input or the preset value of a checkbox or radio button control. We see the attribute referenced a lot in the validation process meaning we treat it as a DOM reference on the client side, and the data associated with the name in the POSTDATA.


There are many times we want to or have to select more than one checkboxes … but if all of them have the same value … how will they be processed  in a formm?

Checkboxes are meant to have zero or more checked, but they will have different values and different names, unlike radio buttons that all have the same name, but different values. We can only ever choose one radio button. There is no such limit on checkboxes.

the way I see it is if you check the box the value will take name of that checkbox andit will match with the name, so for example if it does it works as a “true” value (the user wants the burger with cheese) if the box stays unchecked the value won’t take any value (sorry the redundancy) and it won’t match with the name making it a false (the customer doesn’t want the burger with cheese) am I any right? mind my english.

<input type=""checkbox"" name=""cheese"">

If the above is checked, the POSTDATA will contain,
 &cheese=true

Read this to know how “value” attribute works
The value attribute specifies the value of an  element.
The value attribute is used differently for different input types:
Read this to know how “value” attribute works

For “button”, “reset”, and “submit” - it defines the text on the button
For “text”, “password”, and “hidden” - it defines the initial (default) value of the input field
For “checkbox”, “radio”, “image” - it defines the value associated with the input (this is also the value that is sent on submit)

Hi, I’m totally new to HTML and this was the question in my mind too when I did this exercise. The replies below were generally helpful but including some of the more technical terms like DOM (which is foreign to me), etc. ultimately confused me.
Here’s what (I think) I understand about this use of the ‘value’ attribute here. As we’ve learned from the earlier ‘Text Input’ lesson, after users type into the element, the value of the ‘value’ attribute becomes what is typed into the text field. This user input (or value) is paired with the what’s in the ‘name’ attribute (I’m avoiding the repeated use of ‘value’ here to avoid confusion) of the element and sent as text when the form is submitted. Yes, if we choose to, we could have assigned a default value to pre-fill the form (until this is overwritten by user’s new input) but here it is a checkbox.
Since users cannot type a new input into a checkbox, we have to assign the one and only applicable value for the ‘value’ attribute of each checkbox. When a checkbox receives an input, i.e. a click, this assigned value of the ‘value’ attribute will be paired with the value of the ‘name’ attribute in the element when the form is submitted. For instance, if a user selects ‘Pepperoni’ as it appears beside the checkbox (with a capital ‘P’), the value “pepperoni” (of the ‘value’ attribute, with a small letter ‘p’) will be paired with the value of the name attribute - “topping” - and submitted as “topping=pepporoni”.
Hope the above helps. Please do correct me if I have misinterpreted or misunderstood anything. Thank you in advance.




 hanschowhs:

If it was up to  me, that would be the first term you learn. Have you searched it yet?

Hi mtf, thank you for your advice. I’ve just googled it to roughly understand what DOM is for but I’ve stopped reading further when it gets to using JavaScript to access a webpage’s DOM to change, search for, etc. elements. I’ll leave that till when I start learning JavaScript.
I’ve read many of your posts which have been extremely helpful for beginners like me. Thank you very much!

I love how Wiki-bot asks questions to clarify what’s already on our minds. Thanks wiki-bot! 

Can I number my data or rows?
Like instead of just putting “tr” can I put “tr1”,“tr2” and so on.
Likewise for data, td to td1,td2, and so on.
Would it cause any problems to do code?

Have the same question. Hope, someone can help

@javamaster97346 and @cloud0687405106
No you cannot modify a HTML tag for a html element such as td or tr, you can however add an id tag to the specific element like so:
<tr id=""first_row"">
      <td>...</td>
      <td>...</td>
</tr>

However keep in mind you can only use a specific id tag once. Having two elements with the same id tag is not possible.

If you really needed to label them you could always leave a comment labeling it for yourself later. A comment will not effect the code.

I think wiki-bot is trying to say: Because only one of the rows has table data to show. The other row is still empty so it does not show.

I agree… we set up 2 td but only entered actual data into one row. The white space for the 1st td was ignored.

Bots ask the same question they have been assigned to. I think these questions are strategically placed in order to engage the students. That’s the reason I love codecademy.

So if I have 50 tables with rows and cells in my html code , all of them will show up on the webpage?  Are tables automatically displayed??

I am struggling with table data can someone help me please

In this exercise, why do we do the second row first?

Make sure you put the data in the second row first. The program says either are correct however that may be an issue for the following page. The first set of opening and closing table row tags tags should be empty. Just one suggestion, I am not sure if that solves your problem.

That’s a good question @data8636296807. I’m afraid I don’t know the answer but logic tells me that the browser has a limit where it stops displaying rows (as it wouldn’t size on the screen).
Now my question is with regard to something that happened in the lecture about Introduction to tables, specifically the table data subsection. I don’t know if it’s a bug (I don’t think so), but rather how the browser is prepared for interpreting bad HTML correctly.
So the code I did was the following:
<table>
  <tr>
  </tr>
    <td>Whatever they told me to type in</td>
    <td>Whatever they told me to type in 2</td>
    <td>Whatever they told me to type in 3</td>
  <tr>
  </tr>
</table>

And the system said that it was correct. I know the browser expects to make errors (something amazing and I do not understand) and HTML is a really flexible markup language (although this would be a really bad code). So can this be explained w/o super technical details? Or I must continue studying until I figure out how programs really work?
Clearly the solution is
<table>
  <tr>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Whatever they told me to type in</td>
    <td>Whatever they told me to type in 2</td>
    <td>Whatever they told me to type in 3</td>
  </tr>
</table>

But both compiled correctly. Another suggestion I would make to Codecademy developers and management team is to allow use the indent into the comments. I cannot and I had to type this code on my notepad and then cut it here (using spaces there bc the indent on the notepad is way more lenghty than two spaces). Here if I use the tab it goes to the reply button. Also I would suggest that the default shortcut for the Blockquote and the Preformatted text did erase only the text inside when starting typing and not all the functionality itself. I hope I’m explaining correctly.

They are two completely different attributes. A rowgroup in terms of scope is a group of table rows. It defines a relationship between those rows and the TH used.
rowspan deals with how the cell is drawn. If the rowspan is two or more, it will have the height of that many rows.

108,Why does the browser need information about the type of raw text it will display?,"FAQ,HTML FAQ",q-a,3,"
Question
Why does the browser need information about the type of raw text it will display?
Answer
The browser needs this information so that it can give text meaning within the larger context of the document. In other words, the browser uses this information not only for rendering purposes but also so that it can create a structure which other programs (screen readers for example) can interpret.
","
Considering that all aspects of a web document present from raw text files, we need to distinguish one purpose from another. For this purpose files have a MIME type in their header. text/html says the file is a document source, text/css says it is a style sheet, text/javascript says it is a script file. Each of these MIME types require a different parsing engine for the purpose of loading them into the namespace.

Because the languages that structures the raw text whose browser must convert the content are not the same. The are HTML; CSS; JavaScript for exemple.

109,Do the links in HTML always have to be text?,"FAQ,HTML FAQ",q-a,1,"
Question
In the context of this exercise, do the links in the HTML always have to be text, or can we make other content into a link?
Answer
You can make other types of content of a page into a link, other than just text.
For most content, including text, you can simply turn them into a clickable link by wrapping them between the opening and closing <a></a> tags. Whatever content is inside of the tags will become a clickable link.
For example, this will turn an image into a clickable link.
<a href=""http://www.codecademy.com"">
  <img src=""www.example.com/image.svg"">
</a>

You can also make other HTML elements, such as <p> or <div>, into clickable links. For example,
<a href=""http://www.codecademy.com"">
  <div>Codecademy</div>
</a>

Feel free to experiment with other types of content and see if they can become links!

110,What's the difference between href and src attributes?,"FAQ,HTML FAQ",q-a,5,"
Question
What’s the difference between href and src attributes?
Answer
The href attribute specifies the location (URL) of a resource, that an anchor element points to, or the location of a linked resource, like a stylesheet. While the src attribute is used to embed a resource - usually URLs - into a document, think embedded images (<img>) and <script> tags.
","
I can’t quite wrap my mind around it, this difference is not clear. What’s the difference between specifying a location and embedding a resource?

As mentioned, href requests a resource such as a webpage, a form handler, a block quote reference page, or a style sheet. In many cases (save for style sheets) the link will open a new webpage, from which the back button should return us to the previous page.
src indicates a resource that is embedded in the current document, such as, img, video, audio, or script. The browser will allocate screen real estate depending upon the physical dimensions of the embedded object. href has no such provision.

What does href stand for?
Thanks!

What does href stand for?


HTTP reference

where the HT stands for HyperText, so what we have is a HyperTextReference, or href.
Anchors are bound to what they hook onto, hence the name given to navigation (site or external) links, <a>, where ‘a’ stands for anchor. We can take this into consideration and give href another name that extends the vernacular… hook reference. This is slang. Nonetheless, a valid alias for hypertext reference.

112,Why is indentation important?,"FAQ,HTML FAQ",q-a,4,"
Question
Why is indentation important?
Answer
Indentation in HTML is important, not only because it signifies a relationship between parent/child elements (nested elements), but because it makes an HTML document easier to read.
","
We must also say that the correct formatting or indentation of our code is a good practice, improves the readability of it, both for us and for another person who needs to work on our code or needs to based on it, etc. In fact there are plugins and tools that help us with this.

Much more important than indentation is document outline. No amount of readability can trump a document with a well formed outline. Any experienced reader of HTML can read it with or without the stylized indentation. The markup informs the outline. There is either a good one, or not.
If I was grading a document for quality, it would not be the style guide I’d be using for criteria. I would look only at the outline given in the structure. I wouldn’t even insist on indentation. Prove that you can write a well formed document with a viable outline and you’ll get points from me.

As someone who worked for a web site hosting company, I came across various styles of design coding. Having to troubleshoot another’s code that doesn’t follow common indentation conventions has been a nightmare. I’ve seen code left justified and in a “one-liner”. I’ve told customers that I wouldn’t troubleshoot their site unless they begin to follow normal indentation conventions.

Answer
To get a video element to play automatically on page load, we can add the autoplay attribute to the opening <video> tag, like this:

A couple things to note:

Some browsers disable autoplay, in which case a user would have to change their settings to allow autoplay.
If you decide to use the autoplay attribute specifically with a video source that has an audio track, also consider adding the muted attribute for a better user experiece.

always use POST for sensitive data (login form, register form and so forth). POST will not display the information in the address/url bar.
get will display the information in the URL bar which means the page can be bookmarked (unlike post), get is useful for searching, lets say you have a search box, then get is a good idea.

Do we use figure or figcaption for videos or gifs mentioned in later sections?
","
From what I have read on the topic, <figure> and <figcaption> can be used for videos and gifs.
The <figure> element essentially isolates its content from its ancestor’s content, so it basically separates its content from the rest. This means that whatever’s inside the figure doesn’t contribute to the document outside of it. It behaves as a structural element of the page and can, therefore, contain its own headings, images, videos, audio, and so on.

The figure element represents a unit of content, optionally with a caption, that is self-contained, that is typically referenced as a single unit from the main flow of the document, and that can be moved away from the main flow of the document without affecting the document’s meaning. - HTML5 Doctor

In the lesson,
We placed an image, audio, video, and then GIF. Why didn’t we encapsulate the entire code in
<figure></figure>

or
each individual element in
<figure></figure>

Why was only the image singled out for the example?
Thanks in advance.

It mainly has to do with semantics.
Remember that whatever is in-between the <figure> tags is being isolated from the rest of the document. So this means that you can remove it or move it elsewhere without affecting the flow of the document.
In the example they did, you could put the audio or the video or the gif within their own <figure> tags, but maybe you want the video or the audio or whatever to be part of the main flow, of the document, in which case the figure element isn’t really necessary.
All of the above has to do mainly with semantics. You don’t have to put any of it in a <figure> tag, but maybe in its context it might be the more semantic way of doing it.

Thank you! 

Do I use  and  for videos or audios?
Thanks a lot!

If we use the <figcaption> element then would we still need an alt attribute for the <img>? I still use an alt in my examples and practice but I’m wondering if that’s redundant, because wouldn’t a screen reader also read the content of the <figcaption> element back to the user?

It wouldn’t harm using both for semantic purposes and keeping their syntactic meanings. Use alt attribute for describing the <img> in short but give more elaborate explanation for <figcaption> element like example below.
<figure>
  <img src=""/macaque.jpg"" alt=""Macaque in the trees"">

What does <div> mean?

A post was split to a new topic: Should we include the html tag?

The first instruction says to “Add the paragraph below as a child of the body element.” I did this, above the  element, not within the  element. It shows that this is incorrect and that I should have done it under the  element … but then that would make my  a grandchild, not a child, of the  element. In the HTML structure explanation, I thought when it was mentioned “In this example, the  element is the parent of the 
 element. Both the  and 
 elements are children of the 
 element” that it was optional.  Does this mean that this is always the case, or just in the example they gave?





Wow - what happened to my reply?

You included formatting information in your post, and the forums display them accordingly.  See more information here.

A post was split to a new topic: Can I have more than one div?

2 posts were split to a new topic: What does <div> mean?

Ok, so while I was easilly able to follow the instructions, but as an experiment, I put the following code for use:
<body
Hewwo World
</body
Now,  the problem here is that since the <> brackets (would be very grateful if someone tells me what they’re called in programming languages) are not yet closed, then the browser shouldn’t be able to identify it as a proper tag and shouldn’t the whole code be displayed by the browser? But here, literally nothing is being shown, I tried the same with notepad and chrome too…same results  . Any help would be appreciated :}
Note: I know I am not so smart so if i am missing something very obvious please forgive me ;-;




 allrightwithmight:

tells me what they’re called


Left and right carat. As entities they are known by, &lt; and &gt; as in less than and greater than.
Collectively, left carat + element type + right carat make up a tag.
OPENTAG    ENDTAG
 <body>    </body>

which together form an element.



 allrightwithmight:

shouldn’t the whole code be displayed by the browser?


Browsers are actually quite forgiving and try their best to render the document. They might recognize the incomplete tags and autocomplete. Not the sort of HTML we want facing the web, though. It should always be validated and well formed.

Oh! Thank you so much! All of that knowledge was quite helpful 

It seems that the program will work by simply typing text as content to the  tag or the  tags, without the  tags.  Is that correct?  Why use the 
 tags then?


oops, it didn’t include the tags I typed.
I meant:  It seems that the program will work by simply typing text as content to the div or body tags (ie without using the p tags).  If so, why use the p tags?

Understanding structure of “html” nav. (for some reason my code never displays when I wrap it in ‘’’)
Am I correct in my thinking that the structure of a web page with a navigation list is simply a list of links to other web pages?
This might look like the root folder, with your first html page (or title page if you like) with the navigation links to multiple “sub” folders inside the root folder that each contain their own html pages and possibly links/pictures/videos/sub folders etc?




 joe_shwa:

simply a list of links to other web pages?


Yes, that is correct. The pages may all be in the same folder or in folders of their own.
https://www.example.com/

The above has an index.html page on its site root that is commonly known as the home page. The web domain URL is enough to reach that.
Once we are on the site root, the local navigation ignores the web URL and uses relative URLs.
If index.html is the site rool, then so is, / if referenced in a page. However, that only applies on the site root if a web hosted site. In most cases we will encounter in the meantime we do not have a site root that is the bottom of the WWW volume. That includes on own local machine. Our files are not stored on the volume root, C: but in our Documents folder.
This is where relative addressing comes in.
local_site_root/
+  css/
+  images/
+  js/
-  index.html
-  about.html
-  contact.html
-  gallery.html
-  projects.html

All of the pages are in the same folder as the home page so may be referred with,
<nav class=""site""><ul>
  <li><a href=""about.html"">About Us</a></li>
  <li><!-- ... --></li>
</ul></nav>

Thank you mtf, that was my understanding, I’m glad I am on the right track. Ok, discovered why my code wasn’t displaying. I was trying to enter the code directly into this text box, when I encapsulated my code in my terminal with the ‘’’ ‘’’ and copy and pasted the code into the forum text box, it displays correctly.
eg.

Remember, that URL points to the Volume Root, and furthermore is not written to HTTP requirements which uses the forward slash. Better to use relative addressing centered around your site root (home page).

I’m stuck at the last step in this exercise. I’ve entered <h2>Media</h2> but I keep getting an error asking “Did you create an <h2></h2> header that contains Media?” Is there a way to override and move forward or is there a way to make the system enter the answer so I can see what the error is and then move forward? I’ve already reported the potential bug (recognizing I may be making an error I cannot recognize at this time).  Thanks for your help!

UP, got the  same problem as you. If anyone can help.

Hey Julie, would you mind sharing a screenshot of your code and copy-pasting your formatted code in here too so that we can help?

Code is not working. I have reviewed everything and anything possible but it is not working.

Hi blessed, we could do with some more info if we are going to be able to help you out. Follow this guide to give us the details we need! How to ask a question in our guide

Eventually over the “Next” button you will see a “Solution” button.  Hit this so it corrects everything and shows the solution.  It’s an error in the program because you typed it correctly, but it will let you move on to the next step now

I finished the question but than when I click on next button it will not move. Why?

For #4 i put in Media and Media showed up on the screen in the correct place, yet I did not get this correct.  When i went to solutions, it moved the  up.  Very confusing and misleading.
Why isn’t my complete question displayed?

Just to reiterate, ensure that you are following the instructions very closely. When making a website you will want it to display exactly as intended.
However, if you feel you are doing it all correctly and the lesson isn’t advancing, please report it at help.codecademy.com
Bug reports directly from the user are best as you can post screenshots and information about computer or browser that might help in resolving the problem. Also I recommend using google chrome or Firefox and that refreshing a page can often resolve an issue.

I believe i and everyone else have done this correctly. When I get the solution it is the exact same as my code and believe this to be a bug too.

i actually had something else happen. i put h2/h3 (open and closing <> implied) and it still ran the code the way the lesson wanted me to

121,What is the purpose of the value attribute?,"FAQ,HTML FAQ","forms,q-a",24,"
Why would you want to assigne certain values to the ‘value’ attribute of the checkboxes, if these are not visible on the form itself? Why the use of the ‘value’ attribute here? I thought this was used to pre-fill the form?
","



 stephaniewimber:

Why would you want to assigne certain values to the ‘value’ attribute of the checkboxes, if these are not visible on the form itself?


They are visible in the LABEL. The value is what gets POSTed (when the form is submitted) with the name in the name attribute as its variable…
[name] = [checked value]

I thought the reason why we put the “id” and “for” attributes is to make the label show. why do we have to put value attributes?

As shown above, we only use for if the label does not wrap the input control.



 cloudsurfer00443:

why do we have to put value attributes?


Because that attribute receives the user input. When the form is Submitted, the POST data is assembled as a name-value pair.
<input name=""choice"" value=""user input"">

goes to the POST data as,
choice = ""user input""

In our example we assigned “topping” to be the value of all three name-attributes in our checkboxes.
If I understand it correctly by checking a box the defined value (for example “tomato”) will become the value of my variable “topping”?
Lets say I choose all checkboxes. Will now alle values (e.g. “tomato”, “lettuce”) be attached as one string to the variable “topping”?

Checkboxes permit one or more selections. Any that are checked will be passed along in the POSTDATA.

So, if I check many or all items, does that mean that [name]=[value1, value2,…]?

Yes, although I’m not sure if it is in an array, or just a comma separated list. Something to look into.

And why do we not always need the value attribute for text or number types?

We only need it if is has a preset value. It may also be written as an empty string (value=""""). The input from the user will create the attribute if it is not present in the markup.


What are the differences and characteristics of the “id”, “name” and “value” attributes?
Are both “id” and “name” attributes mandatory for the form tag/element or can we use either of them along with a label tag?




id is the DOM identifier of the element, and it has no bearing on the POSTDATA (submitted form data).

name is a required attribute if the form is being submitted, or for such elements as radio buttons to signify the choice range. It is rarely ever used as a DOM reference.

value is the data object, either the user input or the preset value of a checkbox or radio button control. We see the attribute referenced a lot in the validation process meaning we treat it as a DOM reference on the client side, and the data associated with the name in the POSTDATA.


There are many times we want to or have to select more than one checkboxes … but if all of them have the same value … how will they be processed  in a formm?

Checkboxes are meant to have zero or more checked, but they will have different values and different names, unlike radio buttons that all have the same name, but different values. We can only ever choose one radio button. There is no such limit on checkboxes.

the way I see it is if you check the box the value will take name of that checkbox andit will match with the name, so for example if it does it works as a “true” value (the user wants the burger with cheese) if the box stays unchecked the value won’t take any value (sorry the redundancy) and it won’t match with the name making it a false (the customer doesn’t want the burger with cheese) am I any right? mind my english.

<input type=""checkbox"" name=""cheese"">

If the above is checked, the POSTDATA will contain,
 &cheese=true

Read this to know how “value” attribute works
The value attribute specifies the value of an  element.
The value attribute is used differently for different input types:
Read this to know how “value” attribute works

For “button”, “reset”, and “submit” - it defines the text on the button
For “text”, “password”, and “hidden” - it defines the initial (default) value of the input field
For “checkbox”, “radio”, “image” - it defines the value associated with the input (this is also the value that is sent on submit)
.

Hi, I’m totally new to HTML and this was the question in my mind too when I did this exercise. The replies below were generally helpful but including some of the more technical terms like DOM (which is foreign to me), etc. ultimately confused me.
Here’s what (I think) I understand about this use of the ‘value’ attribute here. As we’ve learned from the earlier ‘Text Input’ lesson, after users type into the element, the value of the ‘value’ attribute becomes what is typed into the text field. This user input (or value) is paired with the what’s in the ‘name’ attribute (I’m avoiding the repeated use of ‘value’ here to avoid confusion) of the element and sent as text when the form is submitted. Yes, if we choose to, we could have assigned a default value to pre-fill the form (until this is overwritten by user’s new input) but here it is a checkbox.
Since users cannot type a new input into a checkbox, we have to assign the one and only applicable value for the ‘value’ attribute of each checkbox. When a checkbox receives an input, i.e. a click, this assigned value of the ‘value’ attribute will be paired with the value of the ‘name’ attribute in the element when the form is submitted. For instance, if a user selects ‘Pepperoni’ as it appears beside the checkbox (with a capital ‘P’), the value “pepperoni” (of the ‘value’ attribute, with a small letter ‘p’) will be paired with the value of the name attribute - “topping” - and submitted as “topping=pepporoni”.
Hope the above helps. Please do correct me if I have misinterpreted or misunderstood anything. Thank you in advance.




 hanschowhs:

some of the more technical terms like DOM


If it was up to  me, that would be the first term you learn. Have you searched it yet?

Hi mtf, thank you for your advice. I’ve just googled it to roughly understand what DOM is for but I’ve stopped reading further when it gets to using JavaScript to access a webpage’s DOM to change, search for, etc. elements. I’ll leave that till when I start learning JavaScript.
I’ve read many of your posts which have been extremely helpful for beginners like me. Thank you very much!

","



 andreafresa416754571:

If I want to encrypt it , how can I do ?


use https (s is for secure, it uses ssl encryption with certificates)



Are `name`, `id`, and `for` required? Can they be the same? And what is the relationship between them?


Why must there be a “name” and “for” attribute? Can’t the code work without them?


for associates a label with an input element. This is needed for people who use disability tools.
name is used to associate the input field with the data send to the server.

is it not bad practice to store a password as plain text? Is their a better way to encrypt it?




 magicmaster125:

is it not bad practice to store a password as plain text?


absolutely, storing passwords as plain text is a horrible idea. But in this lesson we are not storing passwords? We merely make an input field to enter the password
If you would actually submit the form, your website should use HTTPS to securely communicate with the server, where the password should be hashed and stored (register), or be hashed and compared with the hashed stored version (login)

why don’t we use the value attribute in the input set to value=""""?

If that is the value you desire of the input field, then you should. Without more context its difficult to answer the question 

I noticed that we did not use the value attribute in the input in the example below. so i was wondering why was that?
<form>
  <label for=""user-password"">Password: </label>
  <input type=""password"" id=""user-password"" name=""user-password"">
</form>

this is the example we did in the password chapter of forms

Why would you want to give a default value to a password input field? The user should just be able to enter their password

Or we can leave the value attribute blank like value="" "" and use a placeholder=""Password"" attribute instead to give users a sense of what are they supposed to enter. In one of the previous lessons i saw that it was mentioned to use value attribute as its value becomes whatever you type in the text-field,  and is paired with the name attribute to be sent as a text to the destination file.

your value attribute isn’t blank? It contains a white-space. If you leave it blank, the value attribute can be omitted altogether. The value attribute is useful when we want to have a default value
placeholder or a label, or both. Yea, that is possible. If you pay attention to it while visiting different websites, you will see different strategies are used.

Ya i just saw that it contains a white space, thanks for pointing that out!
If we leave it blank, then it can be omitted, but then what about the data that will be sent from the text field. What will it be paired with? I am having confusion with just the pairing of name and value attribute. Do they need to be paired or we can do just fine without pairing?

under the hood, the value is kept track of. The value attribute is useful when we want to overwrite the default value of the input field.

Oh now i get it! Thanks!!  

This all makes sense now.

Question
Can the rowspan attribute only be used within <td> tags?

No. The rowspan attribute can also be used on  <th> tags. For improved accessibility, when we create table headings that span multiple rows, we should also include the scope=”rowgroup” attribute within the opening <th> tag.
","
Why is it again that we would include scope=“rowgroup” attribute and not just use rowspan?
I might have overlooked the explanation for it or forgotten if it was mentioned before.




 method1906679776:

scope=“rowgroup” attribute and not just use rowspan?


They are two completely different attributes. A rowgroup in terms of scope is a group of table rows. It defines a relationship between those rows and the TH used.
rowspan deals with how the cell is drawn. If the rowspan is two or more, it will have the height of that many rows.

Is it already set where the rowspan and colspan attributes expand into(like always expand downwards for rowspan and right for colspan), or do they fill the nearest empty cell?

The rows within your table will not be visible until you have created cells or headings within the <tr> tags. In the next exercise, you will populate the first row with table headings and this row will be visible.

I did not do in yet.√

Because you set up only one line using  tag.

I love how Wiki-bot asks questions to clarify what’s already on our minds. Thanks wiki-bot! 

Can I number my data or rows?
Like instead of just putting “tr” can I put “tr1”,“tr2” and so on.
Likewise for data, td to td1,td2, and so on.
Would it cause any problems to do code?

Have the same question. Hope, someone can help

@javamaster97346 and @cloud0687405106
No you cannot modify a HTML tag for a html element such as td or tr, you can however add an id tag to the specific element like so:
<tr id=""first_row"">
      <td>...</td>
      <td>...</td>
</tr>

However keep in mind you can only use a specific id tag once. Having two elements with the same id tag is not possible.

If you really needed to label them you could always leave a comment labeling it for yourself later. A comment will not effect the code.

I think wiki-bot is trying to say: Because only one of the rows has table data to show. The other row is still empty so it does not show.

I agree… we set up 2 td but only entered actual data into one row. The white space for the 1st td was ignored.

Bots ask the same question they have been assigned to. I think these questions are strategically placed in order to engage the students. That’s the reason I love codecademy.

So if I have 50 tables with rows and cells in my html code , all of them will show up on the webpage?  Are tables automatically displayed??

I am struggling with table data can someone help me please

In this exercise, why do we do the second row first?

Make sure you put the data in the second row first. The program says either are correct however that may be an issue for the following page. The first set of opening and closing table row tags tags should be empty. Just one suggestion, I am not sure if that solves your problem.

That’s a good question @data8636296807. I’m afraid I don’t know the answer but logic tells me that the browser has a limit where it stops displaying rows (as it wouldn’t size on the screen).
Now my question is with regard to something that happened in the lecture about Introduction to tables, specifically the table data subsection. I don’t know if it’s a bug (I don’t think so), but rather how the browser is prepared for interpreting bad HTML correctly.
So the code I did was the following:
<table>
  <tr>
  </tr>
    <td>Whatever they told me to type in</td>
    <td>Whatever they told me to type in 2</td>
    <td>Whatever they told me to type in 3</td>
  <tr>
  </tr>
</table>

And the system said that it was correct. I know the browser expects to make errors (something amazing and I do not understand) and HTML is a really flexible markup language (although this would be a really bad code). So can this be explained w/o super technical details? Or I must continue studying until I figure out how programs really work?
Clearly the solution is
<table>
  <tr>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Whatever they told me to type in</td>
    <td>Whatever they told me to type in 2</td>
    <td>Whatever they told me to type in 3</td>
  </tr>
</table>

But both compiled correctly. Another suggestion I would make to Codecademy developers and management team is to allow use the indent into the comments. I cannot and I had to type this code on my notepad and then cut it here (using spaces there bc the indent on the notepad is way more lenghty than two spaces). Here if I use the tab it goes to the reply button. Also I would suggest that the default shortcut for the Blockquote and the Preformatted text did erase only the text inside when starting typing and not all the functionality itself. I hope I’m explaining correctly.

127,Does HTML regex follow the same rules as Javascript?,"FAQ,HTML FAQ","forms,q-a",11,"
I’ve had a look at MDN’s Regular Expressions page (suggested in this exercise if we want to find out more). I notice that the information here is based on regex in JavaScript. Can all of the same special characters and their different combinations (as shown in the examples on this page) be used in HTML5 (as the pattern attribute’s ""value"") with the same meanings that they have in JavaScript? This post What is a regular expression? that I found says:



What is a regular expression?


The particular sequence which encodes a regular expression is similar but not the same across all languages. Because of this, if you’re interested in experimenting with regular expressions, find the syntax and library specific to your language of choice. You can find this by searching something along the lines of “regular expressions in <MY FAVORITE LANGUAGE>.”


Below, is a link to a page on HTML.com with some explanations and examples of regular expressions that can be used with the pattern attribute, which I found easier to understand. It also explains really well why regular expressions should be used with caution, otherwise they can cause more problems than they solve.
https://html.com/attributes/input-pattern/
Could someone explain what the  d.  (lowercase d followed by a full stop) means in the second example for Username Patterns on this page? 
","



 jon_morris:

be used in HTML5


No. We need a script environment to access the regex engine.




 mtf:

No. We need a script environment to access the regex engine.


So, if we’re just using HTML5 (without a JavaScript environment), would it be best just to stick to the examples on https://html.com/attributes/input-pattern/, or a regex list specific to HTML5, rather than refer to MDN’s Regular Expressions for JavaScript page?
There definitely seems to be some overlap though…?

D’oh!
pattern=""[A-Za-z0-9]+""

Says it all.

allows you to add basic data validation without resorting to JavaScript.

Time for a refresher…

Are the regular expressions that will work with HTML’s pattern attribute just a reduced selection from those available in JavaScript? Or can we literally just lift any of JavaScript’s regex and insert them into pattern=""value""?




 jon_morris:

reduced selection from those available in JavaScript


The engine is outside of the ECMAScript domain. It goes way back in time and has been rigid enough to make every other API come to it.

The answer to the original question is yes, according to https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/text#pattern
’ It must be a valid JavaScript regular expression, as used by the  RegExp  type’




 jon_morris:

lowercase d followed by a full stop


It means \d\. - a digit or a period. The backslashes aren’t displaying and to make matters worse the page refers to them as slashes. e.g. it says ‘Not the slash character’ instead of ‘Not the backslash character’. I recommend avoiding html.com and w3schools and using MDN instead.

That’s really helpful, thanks! I can see now that without the backslash in front of the d it doesn’t make sense and is confusing.
Interestingly, though, I’ve discovered that the period (full stop) doesn’t need a backslash in front of it in order for it to be interpreted literally: I would have thought it was a special character (like * and + etc.), but maybe not…?
So, both [A-Za-z\d.]+ and  [A-Za-z\d\.]+ allow a period to be included anywhere in the input, and any number of times. This also works with other special characters (i.e. without the backslash). Do you think it’s got something to do with the square backets? Any thoughts? 

Just to clarify for anyone else reading this:



 text5695674026:

It means \d\. - a digit or a period.


\d means any digit:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions#special-digit
So, for example, [A-Za-z\d]+ is equivalent to [A-Za-z0-9]+
Without the preceding backslash, d just refers to lower case ‘d’. The backslash indicates that the following d is a special character that means any digit:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions#special-backslash
@text5695674026 Could you confirm you agree with this summary?

Hi Jon, yes that’s much clearer than what I wrote and you’re right, the period isn’t a special character when it’s inside the square brackets so it doesn’t need a backslash there, for further details open this page and search for [xyz]



MDN Web Docs



Regular Expressions
Regular expressions are patterns used to match character combinations in strings. In JavaScript, regular expressions are also objects. These patterns are used with the exec and test methods of RegExp, and with the match, matchAll,...






Great, thanks for confirming that, and for finding the detail in the documentation - I hadn’t spotted that! But, hey, between us we got there!

Question
Can the colspan attribute only be used within <td> tags?

No. The colspan attribute can also be used on  <th> tags. For improved accessibility, when we create table headings that span multiple columns, we should also include the scope=”colgroup” attribute within the opening <th> tag.
","
Could I create each colspan for each column?

Hi,
since each “th” tag forms a column,
I think you meant to ask this question:
can every “th” tag have a colspan attribute?
The answer is YES  because I’ve just tried it now 
and here’s the screenshots :

note: I didn’t give Tuesday and Thursday an colspan attribute and I added an empty table cell “td” for them, I mean that you have to put in mind how much “td” tags you’ve got.
hope that helps

129,"Some videos on the web play automatically, how can I get my video to play automatically?","FAQ,HTML FAQ",q-a,2,"
Question
Some embedded videos on the web play automatically, how can I get my embedded video to play automatically?
Answer
To get a video element to play automatically on page load, we can add the autoplay attribute to the opening <video> tag, like this:
<video width=""320"" height=""240"" autoplay> 
  <source src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/projects/make-a-website/lesson-1/ollie.mp4"" type=""video/mp4""> 
</video>

A couple things to note:

Some browsers disable autoplay, in which case a user would have to change their settings to allow autoplay.
If you decide to use the autoplay attribute specifically with a video source that has an audio track, also consider adding the muted attribute for a better user experiece.

130,Can figure and figcaption be used for videos and gifs as well?,"FAQ,HTML FAQ","semantic-html,q-a",9,"
Do we use figure or figcaption for videos or gifs mentioned in later sections?
","
From what I have read on the topic, <figure> and <figcaption> can be used for videos and gifs.
The <figure> element essentially isolates its content from its ancestor’s content, so it basically separates its content from the rest. This means that whatever’s inside the figure doesn’t contribute to the document outside of it. It behaves as a structural element of the page and can, therefore, contain its own headings, images, videos, audio, and so on.

The figure element represents a unit of content, optionally with a caption, that is self-contained, that is typically referenced as a single unit from the main flow of the document, and that can be moved away from the main flow of the document without affecting the document’s meaning. - HTML5 Doctor

Copy and paste this code into your code editor, and then save it as whatever.html, launch it, and see what happens. Give it a go with Gifs and other types of files.
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    
    <head>
        <title>Testing Figure and Figcaption</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <header>
            <h1>Testing Out Figure and Figcaption on a Video</h1>
        </header>
        <main>
            <figure>
                <iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/WGEpBMxbbFg"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                <figcaption>Here is an interesting video from Codecademy.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>The same formating can be applied to gifs, audio, and other HTML elements.</p>
        </main>    
    </body>
    
</html>

Hope this helps,
Kevin

In the lesson,
We placed an image, audio, video, and then GIF. Why didn’t we encapsulate the entire code in
<figure></figure>

or
each individual element in
<figure></figure>

Why was only the image singled out for the example?
Thanks in advance.

It mainly has to do with semantics.
Remember that whatever is in-between the <figure> tags is being isolated from the rest of the document. So this means that you can remove it or move it elsewhere without affecting the flow of the document.
In the example they did, you could put the audio or the video or the gif within their own <figure> tags, but maybe you want the video or the audio or whatever to be part of the main flow, of the document, in which case the figure element isn’t really necessary.
All of the above has to do mainly with semantics. You don’t have to put any of it in a <figure> tag, but maybe in its context it might be the more semantic way of doing it.

Thank you! 

Do I use  and  for videos or audios?
Thanks a lot!

If we use the <figcaption> element then would we still need an alt attribute for the <img>? I still use an alt in my examples and practice but I’m wondering if that’s redundant, because wouldn’t a screen reader also read the content of the <figcaption> element back to the user?

It wouldn’t harm using both for semantic purposes and keeping their syntactic meanings. Use alt attribute for describing the <img> in short but give more elaborate explanation for <figcaption> element like example below.
<figure>

However, if you feel you are doing it all correctly and the lesson isn’t advancing, please report it at help.codecademy.com
Bug reports directly from the user are best as you can post screenshots and information about computer or browser that might help in resolving the problem. Also I recommend using google chrome or Firefox and that refreshing a page can often resolve an issue.

I believe i and everyone else have done this correctly. When I get the solution it is the exact same as my code and believe this to be a bug too.

always use POST for sensitive data (login form, register form and so forth). POST will not display the information in the address/url bar.
get will display the information in the URL bar which means the page can be bookmarked (unlike post), get is useful for searching, lets say you have a search box, then get is a good idea.

start and type were deprecated in HTML 4 but re-introduced in HTML5.

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes

start is still valid when used in an <ol> OPENTAG. It’s only needed if the starting number is not 1.
style is a global attribute, but best practice is to avoid inline styles.
There is list property, list-style-type where we can specify the type of bullet. list-style can be used to disable bullets.

 techbecca:

where do the answers to the form end up after they’ve been sent?


The <form> element opentag will have an action="""" attribute with the URL of the request page on the server. That page will read the POST data, validate it and make it safe to insert in the database (encode it), then do so. That page will likely handoff a success response, or a failure response, as applies. That page (or AJAX response) will be composed and sent back to the client.
Given only those two pieces of information, name and email, it’s likely this would be a signup for a subscription. When the row is created in the database, it may also be added to the mailing list of the periodical.

 mohammedmadroumi:

… that are recognized by browsers so that default styles exist.
HTML is a living language. The meaning of that can be elusive. It actually does mean that anything can be written between the carats and be a valid tag. It goes right back to XML where we’re not marking up content, but data. If we determine that a <species> element is useful for describing data there is nothing stopping us in HTML specs. We can simply create that element. We might have to tell the DOM that, but that is another story. You are not that far off in your thinking.
Bottom line, elements that are already written into the specs are the ones to use. Some have both OPENTAG and ENDTAG, and others have only VOIDTAG that have no content, such as IMG or INPUT. While we are free to create new tags, it is not something we need to engage in at this point.

Is the option tag a self-closing tag?

 breekiki:

option tag a self-closing



Start tag: required , End tag: optional

That is for HTML 4, so one can assume it is still the case with HTML5. However, when the stricter XML compliance rules apply, it may not be the case.
HTML can be served as text/html or as application-x/xml, the latter adhering to the stricter spec.
Going through the HTML5 docs I’m still looking for clarification…

https://dev.w3.org/html5/pf-summary/forms.html#the-option-element


Hi, no expert here, but, if you don’t use the closing tag </option> here at codecademy the linter or whatever it is that puts a red dot on the code line number will show it’s not right. So most likely it’s not a self closing tag. Empty elements and void elements and self-closing are all three the same thing.




 wispring:

So most likely it’s not a self closing tag.


But it is when inside a <datalist/>. Linters don’t tell us if markup is valid, just if it has some quality issues.
validator.w3.org is where to get the real low down on our markup.

You are evidently much more knowledgeable about this area of computer technology than i am ok. But, I am not convinced <option>is a void or self closing tag just because in a few cases you don’t need the closing tag Link to the HTML5 specification of this tag. Maybe i am being a little too specific or narrow on this, but, a void or self closing tag like <br>and <img> never needs a closing tag and I think of them as a true void or self closing tag. Whereas <option> just acts like a void or self closing tag with regard to whether or not you or I need to put the closing tag in under specific circumstances. I would like to thank you for your answer as it has really helped me in sharpening my critical thinking skills with respect to learning the HTML5 computer language. I agree with you whole heartedly about W3C people being the ultimate authoritative source to go to though. They seem to be in charge of the actual development and evolution of the language itself to the best of my understanding.

Hey @board1023928696!
What kind of trouble are you having?

Why are there no other size heading elements within HTML?
For example: h7, or even bigger: h0.5
PS. I tried to write the heading elements with the correct syntax but the comment window actually took it for real HTML code!

Hello, @booga.
The <h1> through <h6> tags are to be used as headings. You can use other methods to make your own headings as big or small as you like. For example:
<h1>This is a heading</h1>
<p style=""font-weight: bold; font-size: 50px>This looks like a heading only bigger</p>
renders:
This is a heading

Note: The above is a screen shot. Inline styling apparently isn't rendered by the Markdown used in the forums
There are many ways to manipulate text to look the way you want it to. The built-in headings are for quick use when the default style is all you need. You can also change the default style of the heading tags to suit your needs using CSS.

Please review this topic to see how to include code in a post: How do I format code in my posts?

I notice that when I use h7 tag, for example, the text font defaults to a nonbold font of a certain size.  Would that be different font depending on the developer I’m using?

141,How can I create a default value that disappears when the user types in the form?,"FAQ,HTML FAQ","forms,q-a",7,"
What code could I use to show a default value that will disappear once you write the first character (without the need to delete the default value using supr or the backspace key as it happens in the exercise) in the cell where the information should be submitted?
This is something I have seen in many website forms and I think it enhances the UX.
To show what I mean, the searcher of this website can serve as an example:



Rotten Tomatoes



Rotten Tomatoes: Movies | TV Shows | Movie Trailers | Reviews
Rotten Tomatoes, home of the Tomatometer, is the most trusted measurement of quality for Movies & TV. The definitive site for Reviews, Trailers, Showtimes, and Tickets





","
To do this you should use placeholder attribute. Quote from MDN:

placeholder
A hint to the user of what can be entered in the control . The placeholder text must not contain carriage returns or line-feeds. This attribute applies when the value of the  type  attribute is  text ,  search ,  tel ,  url  or  email ; otherwise it is ignored.

For example, this is the search input field from Rotten Tomatoes:
<input type=""text"" name=""search"" class=""form-control"" placeholder=""Search movies, TV, actors, more..."" id=""fullscreen-search-term"" autocomplete=""off"" value="""">


Thanks, factoradic! I put what you said into practice and it worked!

How can I put the placeholder text in italics ? I tried using emphasis tags, but it didn’t work. Is it possible to do it with HTML, or does that need to be done with CSS? Thanks in advance!

i hope you will find the answer here

Why would I use id on the input?
I don’t have a good understanding of id, can you help me out with an explanation or recommendation of a webpage/book?

id and class are selectors we are using them to style the elements in the CSS , the difference between an ID and a class is that an ID can be used to identify one element, whereas a class can be used to identify more than one.
while learning HTML you will not use them so don’t worry you will understand them well in the CSS lessons.

","



 adamjamiu1087939493:

<input id=“answer” name=“burger” value="" yes"" type=“radio”> YES


When we give an INPUT element an ID attribute, it is there as a hook for a LABEL.
<input id=“burger” name=“burger” value=""yes"" type=“radio”>
<label for=""burger"">YES</label>

or
<label for=""burger"">YES</label>
<input id=“burger” name=“burger” value=""yes"" type=“radio”>

The text in the label goes to the screen, the value goes to the POST data with the name burger
burger = 'yes'


Extended
<label>YES
<input name=“burger” value=""yes"" type=“radio”>
</label>

or
<label>
<input name=“burger” value=""yes"" type=“radio”>
YES</label>

Note above that the label wraps the input control. In that case we do not apply an ID attribute since the control is a child of the label.

145,How is the information transferred from the checkbox?,"FAQ,HTML FAQ","forms,q-a",2,"
In a form , while using multiple input tags having the same name attribute of type “checkbox”
input type=“checkbox”
when we select multiple checkboxes , how the information is stored and transferred from the form to the action attribute?
By information , I mean multiple values from the selected checkboxes (input tags).
","



 data8636296807:

how the information is stored and transferred from the form to the action attribute?


The action attribute contains the URL of the form handler, typically a server-side script that parses the query string attached to the request. On the client side, form values are transformed into that query string on Submit. This is done internally by the browser.
"
146,What if I want to limit the number of check boxes that can be selected?,"FAQ,HTML FAQ","forms,q-a",8,"
If needed how would I limit the amount of check boxes that can be selected? In this exercise I could select all three of them, but lets think that you’re limited to only 1 topping.
Thanks!
","
Checkboxes intentionally allow multiple selections. Radio buttons, on the other hand will only permit one item to be selected.

Checkboxes vs. Radio Buttons


Thanks! And is there an in-between? Not only one option but not all of them neither?

Since checkboxes are essentially independent and do not represent selection from a group the way radio buttons do, we would need to implement our own control over the maximum allowable selections. Bear in mind that it goes against the grain of checkboxes, since it would forbid the completely normal, Select All checkbox.
That is not to say, “don’t do it,” just that it is atypical to impose limits on a checkbox list.
One particular use would be a selection from a list by keyword or label, then toggling it so all others may be selected (for removal, or whatever). Gmail would be an example of potential usage for such a feature.
To my best recollection, HTML does not give us a mechanism to limit checkboxes. If my memory is bad, so be it. There is still a way to do it with the DOM, though, once we give it some thought.
The first consideration is the POSTDATA object that is created when we Submit a form. But that would be something easier to analyze server-side.
The second consideration would be to inspect the form values onsubmit, as it were, though this could get messy with sending the form up to the server.
The third consideration would be to post a listener on that section of the form and keep track of the number of checkboxes checked, then disable that section of the form when the maximum is reached. This would not interfere with the submit event.

mtf, you are an absolute gem. I appreciate how thorough you are with all of your explanations on all the FAQs, it is beyond helpful!

Makes complete sense! As I went through radio buttons I understood what you meant by selecting from a group (and I think this could also be a suitable solution when the time comes, right?).
Anyway, thanks again!

Once you get into scripting, take another look at this challenge. Say we have six choices and wish the user to select any three. As forms go, design is everything. Usability is one of the reasons some people simply won’t use them.

Amen to that, Stevie.

147,Why are some tags self-closing whereas others are not?,"FAQ,HTML FAQ",q-a,1,"
Question
Why are some tags self-closing (<img>, <br>, etc.)  whereas others are not ?
Answer
The important distinction between self-closing tags and all other tags is that self-closing tags represent void elements. Void elements like <img> and <br> cannot contain any content. All other tags may (but are not required to) contain content.
",
148,Why don't we need the action and method attributes anymore?,"FAQ,HTML FAQ",forms,2,"
Why is it that from exercise 5 onwards the form-tag in the explanation screen on the left no longer has the attributes action=""/example.html"" and method=“POST”>?
","
I must be very late to answer, but I think it might still help.
I think they have not included the mentioned attributes because they just wanted to tell us the meaning and use of those attributes in the beginning. Since in these programs, we are not actually sending any values, but we are just learning how to use the different elements in forms, those attributes are actually not needed.
Hope this helps,
Thanks.
"
149,What happens if we don't add a closing tag?,"FAQ,HTML FAQ",,4,"
Question
In the context of this exercise, what happens if we don’t add a closing tag for an HTML element?
Answer
If you do not add a closing tag for an HTML element, you may end up with unexpected issues with your webpage. However, excluding a closing tag will not cause error messages or crashes, so they technically are not an absolute requirement. But, this does not mean you should exclude them.
One important reason to add a closing tag is that anything that follows an opening tag in the HTML code will become nested in that element. For example, say you meant to have two separate elements, such as a <div> and a <p> element. Like so,
<body>
  <div>
  </div>
  <p>
  </p>
</body>

If you omit the closing tags of the elements, like so
<body>
  <div>
  <p>
</body>

then the paragraph element is now nested inside the div element. This can cause many issues in terms of layout and design of a webpage.
Adding closing tags is also best practice, and should always be included. If you do that then errors will be avoided, and it will reduce confusion when other developers are working on the same code.
Some elements do not need a closing tag (known as “void” tags), such as <br>, <img>, and <link> tags, because they do not have content. But for other types of elements, you should always add a closing tag to them.
","
I thought that a error message would pop up, but I’m new, and I was wrong.
@mtf Explains it below.




 tonescript:

An error message will be on your screen, and the line of code will not work.


HTML does not provide error messages. The browser will make an attempt to render the markup, and if it fails to, it just continues on to the next item in normal flow.



 jephos249:

(known as “void” tags)


void elements, which are self-closing tags, to keep things semantic.

Ah. Thank you for telling me. I only joined recently.

@mtf Thanks.

Why don’t the table heading elements in the example table given for this exercise include scope attributes?

2 posts were split to a new topic: What code editor should I use?

Can you use colspan and rowspan in the same  tag?

When I increased the rowspan attribute it appeared to also increase the height size of the other rows as well–is this standard or just in the exercise?

So I tried spanning a  element across 1 row vs 4 rows to see the difference like so:


  <td colspan=""2"">what</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td rowspan =""4"">we are</td>
</tr>

But there was no difference and it didn’t span across 4 rows. Can anyone please tell me why?

I have not been able to successfully get this rowspan element in without having the columns messed up or for the code to completely stop working ie. forever running loading circle. Can someone maybe explain to me why we want to firstly add a  “span a  <td>  element across two rows.”? I don’t actually get why we are doing this. It seems to break up the table not make it better. And secondly if you can explain to me the process for this new addition to our code.
A snippet of my code:
div class=“search”>Search the table
<th>Adam's Greenworks</th>

<td rowspan=""2""></td>

<th>14</th>

<th>Package Items</th>
Here’s a picture of my code and forever loading circle:
https://gyazo.com/4e5c77506af3f143074b491c9398c5a9


Company Name
Number of Items to Ship
Next Action




Davie's Burgers
2
Send Invoice




I think its because you’re missing enough empty rows after



 uchechukwu75:

<td rowspan =""4"">we are</td>


for your td to occupy. I checked it in the excercise by adding
<td rowspan=""4"">Adam's Greenworks</td>
which then does occupy the next 4 rows




 etheriei:

Can someone maybe explain to me why we want to firstly add a “span a <td> element across two rows.





 etheriei:

<td rowspan=""2""></td>


your <td> element doesn’t contain any data to span 2 rows. maybe that messes up the rendering. your code should probably look more like this:
<th scope=""rowgroup"">Adam's Greenworks</th>
(or <td>Adam's Greenworks</td> if you don’t want to style this as a row header and keep it as a data point instead)
<td rowspan=""2"">14</td>
(now the entry of 14 should occupy two rows of it’s column.)
<td>Package Items</td>



 etheriei:

Here’s a picture of my code and forever loading circle:


from your picture it seems you have used the <th> element almost exclusively. I don’t think that’s best practice (presumably because of semantics and later styling, I haven’t started css yet). You should probably use the <td> element for data entries and use <th> only for headers with a scope for the row or column accordingly.

152,How are the main and body tags used together?,"FAQ,HTML FAQ","semantic-html,q-a",6,"
why I use “main” instead of “body” tag?
","



 muslehuddinrobin0410:

“main” instead of “body”


Welcome to the forums.
We would not use it instead of BODY, but as a child of the body.
body
    header
    main
    footer

Isn’t “main” used outside of “body” in the given example sir?

In well formed markup, the <body></body> is the outermost content container. It’s sibling is the <head></head> element that contains all the metadata. <header></header>, <main></main>, and <footer></footer> are all children of the body, at the very least, though they could be children of <section></section> or <article></article>, which are also descendents of BODY.
If we look at the specifications we will find that HEAD and BODY are optional elements, though we don’t see this in practice for a full blown web page. Typically page fragments that are merged with the page via AJAX are stored as plain HTML, but the following is valid for simple documents…
<html>
  <div>
    <h1>heading<h1>
    <p>textual content</p>
    <p>textual content</p>
    <p>textual content</p>
    <p>textual content</p>
  </div>
</html>

If our document uses <html></html> to wrap it, then it is HTML that it contains.

Edited May 13, 2020
See following post concerning error in above markup.

<h1>heading<h1>


at this code when you see
<h1>heading<h1>
change to
<h1>heading</h1>

That only took five months for someone to point out. Good eyes!

153,Why would a section element be placed inside an article element?,"FAQ,HTML FAQ","semantic-html,q-a",6,"
Why would anyone place the section element inside the article element?
","
Now the question becomes, “Why not?” They are both sectioning elements, and it would seem natural for an article to have multiple sections. Sections are akin to an outline within a document or article.

Thank you very much. Now I see the point.
On the other hand, I have read some of your replies (to other newbie users like me) that have been really helpful to me. Thanks for that, too.

Aren’t sections of an article generally called paragraphs? Or would a section be a paragraph that is illustrated with an image for instance?

Hi !
As I’m just on this lesson (4 on Semantic HTML), this may help you :
""<section> defines elements in a document, such as chapters, headings, or any other area of the document with the same theme. For example, content with the same theme such as articles about cricket can go under a single <section> . A website’s home page could be split into sections for the introduction, news items, and contact information.""
Remember that a paragraph in litterature doesn’t have quite the same meaning as .
Hope this helps !


https://www.examples.com/education/research-paper-outline.html

sample_outline443×553 111 KB
The big Roman lines could indicate section or article with those lines as headings and containing paragraphs, lists, images, etc… The capitals could indicate section or article with those lines as headings, paragraphs, etc.
The finer the detail (drilling down through the outline) the more embedded it will be in the paper. Our HTML document should adopt a similar outline to the page structure.

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Using_HTML_sections_and_outlines

SECTION and ARTICLE are sectioning elements, among the many others such as DIV, BLOCKQUOTE, MAIN, HEADER, FOOTER, ASIDE, and yes, even P. Blockquotes and paragraphs have default styles, the others do not.

Can I use the <p> element for a heading?
Answer
The paragraph (<p>) element should not be used as a heading element. The <p> element is used to represent a paragraph of text and would not be best practice to use as a heading. If we want to use the same styling a paragraph element has, on a heading element, we can change that styling in our CSS.

2 posts were split to a new topic: What are all the attributes and when do we use them?

I am trying to do the exercise for Attributes.  I need to see the correct code beccause I just can’t figure it out.  Can you help?

you can get the code? I am personally not a fan of this feature, but after submitting faulty code enough times a button appears from which you can get the code. I usually do explanations.

that is the issue, you get the “get solution” button but your code does not change and you only see ticks that it has been completed.

I am not able to understand what is the use of the id and division tags

Do you need to use the id tag to close a division

id tag? You mean id attribute? This one:



MDN Web Docs



id
The id global attribute defines a unique identifier (ID) which must be unique in the whole document. Its purpose is to identify the element when linking (using a fragment identifier), scripting, or styling (with CSS).





?
if you mean id attribute, then the answer is: no

So, I understand the attributes feature to div tags. Is the only purpose of adding an attribute to div tags to differentiate divs from each other for styling them in CSS?

css does positioning as well, any decent website has a lot of div tags for a good layout

I am following the tutoring class but after I do the changes suggested and  click on Run it take a long time to give results is spinning for minutes at every change is very upsetting, this definitely is not acceptable to a person learning anything I do not have the time and patience to do this.

156,Is the <head> element a heading element?,"FAQ,HTML FAQ",q-a,1,"
Question
Is the <head> element a heading element?
Answer
Heading elements (<h1> - <h6>) are used to create section headings in the HTML that we will see rendered to a website - think a heading with some content underneath. For example:
<h1>I'm a Heading Element</h1>
<p>I'm content underneath!</p>

The head (<head>) element is completely different - it provides information about the HTML document - think the title of the HTML document, link to a stylesheet, among other information that we will not see rendered to a website. For example:
<head>
  <meta charset=""utf-8"">
  <meta name=""viewport"" content=""width=device-width"">
  <title>Title of my website</title>
  <link rel=""stylesheet"" href=""./css/style.css"">

How to make a table only with vertical headings?

How do I make the table headers span 2 columns wide?  All of my data was shifted weird in the excercises that had me increase the column span to 2.

You can use colspan = 2

Why does we use the class attributes?

Can anyone tell me how to skip a line in these table?
like a gap between “total” and the company names.
Thanks, Have a fantastic day ^-^

Why is this happening? th can’t have rowspan? the 3rd th is on the second row…
It’s taking colspan for the 2nd th
  <tr>
      <th>I'm the 1st th</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th rowspan=""2"" >I'm the 2nd th</th>
      <td>I'm the 1st td</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>I'm the 3rd th<tr>
        </tr>

I did not understand how to aplly css style

How does style.css work?

Is there a way to use span for an entire column or row without adding colspan / rowspan to each relevant line?
Thanks in advance

why are you using th for the companie’s name in the first page of the exercise and then using td in the rest of the exercise? i believe the right thing to do would be to use td since, for exemple: i could lose the contract with one of the company and would want to remove them from my buyers/shipping list, so i would remove some “data”, not an “heading”

158,Does a website have to have HTML and CSS?,"FAQ,HTML FAQ",q-a,1,"
Question
Does a website have to have HTML and CSS?
Answer
Yes, and no.  HTML is a markup language needed to build websites - it gives structure and content to a webpage.  Browsers like Chrome, Firefox, Safari, IE, etc read/interpret HTML documents to render webpages. The browser can also render image files and other file formats.
When you access a URL, https://www.codecademy.com/learn for example, your computer is sends a request to the server hosting the site, the server processes the request, and will respond to your browser - usually with an HTML document for the browser to read and render.
CSS is a language that describes the presentation, or styling, of an HTML page.  Usually HTML documents will reference a CSS file that the browser will read and interpret to give styling to the HTML page, but is not required to make a website.

hello there, i was wondering the effect of div tag only happens on the written code or it has effect when we execute our code ?

When inserting a div around elements, is it necessary to indent the closing div? Or should there just be a space between the opening div and the rest of the element? How exactly does this improve readability?

Consider,
<div><div><div><div><div></div></div></div></div></div>

How readable is that? Yet, the browser has no problem disseminating it.
No white space was used at all, yet those DIVs will all render accordingly. What’s more, CSS and DOM script can narrow in on any one of them.
White space has practically no meaning in HTML. By ‘practiclally’ we mean that one space will be rendered in all cases.
<p>here is       some text</p>

Thank you very helpful.

Hi to everyone, it’s my first post / question. In the example given on the left panel of this exercise, I know ‘body’ tag  is the super-grand-daddy or the Adam / Eve in the whole scheme of things but how do I know ‘h1’ and ‘p’ tags belong to the same level of descendents, i.e sibiling children of ‘div’ tag in this case?
In short, how do I know whether the next opening tag or tags should be indented with two spaces to mean it’s a child that follows next? Thank you very much in advance!

Indentation is not needed in HTML. It does make nesting more visible.
<parent>
    <child>

    </child>
</parent>

In the above pseudo code, we say the child is nested in the parent. Indentation makes it easier to see child elements and identify their parent.

Hi there, and welcome to the community!
So the <body></body> tags encompass all the elements that will be visible on the screen.
<html>
<head>
  <!-- This isn't visible -->
</head>
<body>
  <!-- Everything here will be visible -->
</body>
</html>

Then, you have to think of the elements within the body in terms of blocks, or sections. This is how you’ll organize content within the body of the document. That’s where div comes in handy.
div will represent a block, a division within the body content that will serve as a container for a section of the document that contains its own elements. The div will group content that’s related.
You know how on a web page, you can usually find a header with a logo up top, and a footer with some links and a copyright notice at the bottom? These are sections of the document. Everything in between will represent another section.
<body>
  <div><!-- This is our header --></div>
  <div><!-- This is the main content --></div>
  <div><!-- This is our footer --></div>
</body>

Notice the indentation for those divs? This is because they’re direct children of the body.
Now we can start adding children elements to the divs.
<body>

  <div id=""our-header"">
    <img id=""our-logo"">
    <div id=""our-navigation"">
      <ul>
        <li>Home</li>
        <li>Services</li>
        <li>Blog</li>
        <li>About</li>
        <li>Contact Us</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </div>

</body>

Here, notice that “our-header” is a section that has a set of children and grand-children.
The div “our-logo” and the div “our-navigation” are both direct children of “our-header”, so they’ll be indented the same way within their parent block.
But then, “our-navigation” contains an ul (unordered list), which is a child of “our-navigation”. Since it is a direct child, we’ll give it some indentation. The unordered list itself has children, the li (list item) elements, that are its direct children. So they’ll also receive some indentation to support that visually.
But as @mtf just said, indentation isn’t necessarily needed.
You could write the same code like this:
<body>
<div id=""our-header"">
<img id=""our-logo"">
<div id=""our-navigation"">
<ul>
<li>Home</li>
<li>Services</li>
<li>Blog</li>
<li>About</li>
<li>Contact Us</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</body>

It wouldn’t change a thing. But it’d be slightly more difficult for us to navigate. So, visually speaking, indentation helps. But that’s about it.

Answer
The <tbody> <thead> and <tfoot> tags that we learned about in this lesson give our tables semantic meaning. These sectioning semantic tags improve the user experience in a number of ways:

Lesson 10, linking to same page.
can i link to the id using ordered lists or only unordered lists?

if the list elements contain anchor elements, then yes

I’m studying on HTML DOCUMENT STANDARDS/10.Linking to Same Page
I followed the intructions  and system agreed to pass to next level,but when I checked back, I noticed something unexpected. When I click on the media at the local host side ( third line under The Brown Bear’ , it does not directly go to the line of media ( over the bear photo) What I see at top of the page is the line writing ‘3. Canada’ .Does that happen, because it’s the end of the page or is there a problem? Because other two links take you directly to the top of the page. Hope I did not ask complicated?




 eylemozcan:

.Does that happen, because it’s the end of the page or is there a problem


yep, its because of end of page. Html is just a markup language, there is happening so much under the hood

What does the # character do?

Bonjour, je ne comprends pas a quoi correspond  car pour l’exercice 10 j’ai réussi sans inclure  ? merci


Why on this exercise the ordered list opening tag is <ul> and not <ol> like previously explained?

UL is unordered list with bullets, as opposed to ordered list with numbers or letters.




 mtf:

as opposed to ordered list with numbers or letters.


Thanks! I just figured it out 

How come you need to use the # symbol when referencing an id tag? In the lesson we have it . Wouldn’t we just be able to call ""href=“habitat”? Or does the “#” only apply to ids?




 menace85:

""href=“habitat”?


That link will go nowhere. We must include the hash so the browser knows to look for a page fragment with id=""habitat"".



 menace85:

Or does the “#” only apply to ids?


Correct, only ids in the markup. In CSS they symbolize the id selector.
#habitat {

}

I was wondering the same. Also whether it best to write the href # string full lout like #introduction or that short abbreviations like #intro are better.
I have a sense of what the answer will be (something along the line off readability for other developers)  but wonder if there is a best practice answer 




 pmbx-alter8041771767:

like #introduction or that short abbreviations like #intro are better.


There is no better in this example, only what we subjectively prefer. To be objective we should leave no room for ambiguity so abbreviations should probably be avoided, thus giving the reader a clear picture what the id denotes. A familiar abbreviation, like ‘intro’ is perfectly fine so long as we associate it immediately with the word ‘introduction’.

I’m very confused as to why the exercise does not register my link for “habitat.” I included a photo. Thoughts?


I was doing just fine until I got to “Linking To Same Page.”  # 1.  Was a breeze.  But the 2nd part of the exercise has me stumped.

Any link that looks like this,
<a href=""#"">Link text</a>

is requesting the current page landing point.

162,How do we know if information is best presented tabularly?,"FAQ,HTML FAQ",q-a,1,"
Question
How do we know if information is best presented tabularly?
Answer
When trying to determine whether or not a dataset is best represented tabularly, there are several factors to consider and this can very quickly become quite involved.
One important factor to consider when trying to determine how to best represent your data is “will my data have ragged rows?”. As tabular data is inherently rectangular, every rows of our dataset should have the same number of column headers. If there is a mismatch here, we will need to either store “missing values” within cells or consider a different data representation model.

Hey Damian,
There isn’t. The key, in my humble opinion, is consistency:




<form> <input - semantics HTML


    It doesn’t matter, but it could. 
What I’d personally advise, is to keep it consistent. Pick one of the three, and stick to it. 
It’ll be much easier to navigate through your code and quickly make changes when needed, without having to go through each line, every time, looking for that specific attribute. Especially when having to go back to your code months/years after last touching it. 
Also, it could matter, if you end up sharing your code with other developers. If they know that the attribut…
  


Why do we use radio buttons when we can create the same thing just using type checkbox?
I don’t see how radio buttons are necessary

Check boxes are independent and can have more than one checked in a group. Radio buttons in the same group (having the same name attribute) can only have one item selected.

Thank you, I guess I would become more organized and consistent as a i grow my experience

If more is less, why do we keep assigning and id to every input type. I understand they may come in handy when incorporation CSS into it, but won’t we have extraneous code all over the place with elements we might not ever touch in CSS? Also, won’t we start running out of id names if code gets dense enough?
Thank you.




 design6829821206:

come in handy when incorporation CSS


Yes, and no. We can traverse a form without any fragment identifiers. Same applies to script. However, it takes time and effort to design it so most authors will go with what’s simplest.
Take the <label/> element, for instance. We can have a freestanding label (opened and closed) anywhere in the form markup and give it a for attribute and a screen reader or user agent will immediately associate it with the form control having a matching id attribute.
<label for=""item"">Item </label>
<input id=""item"" placeholder=""Your item"">
<input id=""todo"" placeholder=""Your to-do"">
<label for=""todo""> To-Do</label>

We can rid our markup of both attributes simply by nesting the <input> within the <label/>.
<label>Item 
  <input placeholder=""Your item"">
</label>
<label>
  <input placeholder=""Your to-do"">
To-Do</label>

css
body {
  font-size: 100%;
}
label {
  display: block;
  height: 1em;
  padding: 0.3em;
}
label:hover {
  background-color: #fdfeff;
  border: 1px solid #ccc;
}


https://repl.it/@mtf/form-labels-without-id-and-for


I feel it’s not so clear on why and how Radio Button only allows the user to choose only one choice among the provided options, so I looked it up a bit…
Basically the key is to group the Radio Buttons together under the same “name” attribute group, so that only one choice under the same “name” attribute group can be chosen without overlapping.
On the other hand, if you put each Radio Button under their own unique “name” attribute group, all of the options can be selected without problems, but that’s not the intention here. So be careful when giving “name” attribute in a Radio Button input. If one wants to have multiple groups of Radio Buttons, they can just give different “name” attribute group to group each Radio Button group and that would work.

Hope that helps!

There are quite a few tags but try not to get too overwhelmed. While it is a good idea to skim through the element list shared in this exercise, there is no need to try to memorize them all. The more web sites you make the more familiar you will become with the elements you have at your disposal.

167,Should I use a <p> tag or a <div> tag?,"FAQ,HTML FAQ",q-a,1,"
Question
I notice I can use either <div> or <p> elements in the workspace and the paragraphs seems to display exactly the same. Since it doesn’t seem to matter much one way or another, which element should I use here and why?
Answer
This is a great discovery as it illustrates that <div> and <p> elements have something in common: they are both block level elements. As such, the browser renders these elements in the same way. It is up to the developer to pick the tag which best describes the content it will contain. When we are dealing with paragraphs, the semantically correct tag to pick would be the <p> tag.

Question
Why doesn’t the controls attribute need a value, like all the other attributes we have seen thus far?
Answer
Unlike the other attributes you have seen thus far, the controls attribute is an example of a Boolean attribute. Boolean attributes have true/false conditions. Including a Boolean attribute  within an element signifies the condition is true (or on) while omitting it signifies the condition is false (or off).
In this case, including the controls attribute within the opening video tag means “turn the controls on”. We might even say that this is the truthy condition.

170,"With semantic HTML, do we no longer use the div element?","FAQ,HTML FAQ",semantic-html,8,"
With semantic elements the div element is no longer used?
","
Hi,
From the introduction to semantic HTML, the div element is a non-sematic element which means that the div element does not provide information about the content between the opening tags and closing tags.
We are advised to used semantic HTML element to enhance accessibility, Search Engine Optimization, and readability.

With advanced styling, you will notice that you need to enclose one block within another within another and so on, and in these settings using <div> with class and/or id is just practical. But whenever you build a main structure of your website, you should use semantic elements for all the reasons mentioned before.

I am new to HTML. Now that I know that using div element is non-semantic and we are advised to use semantic HTML elements, why we use div element at all? Does the div element still have purpose?

There is a limited number of semantic elements and you might decide that <div> with a class (like wrapper, container, jumbotron etc) may be more appropriate, particularly when you style your website. This is how I understand and use it. Whenever I can use a semantic element, I favour it, though.

Thanks so much! I appreciate your rapid reply.

Question
Why is the code on line 1 white whereas all the other HTML tags are pink?
Answer
Line one is not actually an HTML element or tag. As you will discover in lesson 2,  it is a declaration that lets the browser know that it is looking at an HTML5 document and it should be parsed  accordingly.
Text editors like the one you are using in this workspace often use different colors to help developers distinguish between different pieces of code and to aid in overall readability.

172,Why does the example have an empy `<th>`?,"FAQ,HTML FAQ","tables,q-a",16,"

Untitled2021×740 213 KB

Could someone please take a look at this? I’ve been stressing out over the table headings lesson for over an hour to no avail. Could someone let me know what im doing wrong? https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-html/lessons/tables/exercises/table-headings this is the lesson.
","
I’ve also seen something about a  tag but it mentions nothing about this in the lesson.

The empty TH element could be the problem.

I only did that because the lesson on the left had put it too.
However I’ve tried it without and still doesn’t work.

At some point the instructions might have asked for a THEAD?
Eg.
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Company Name</th>
        <th>Number of Items to Ship</th>
        <th>Next Action</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>


Ive gone back through the instructions twice and it at no point mentioned a thead, however the solution you just gave me worked so i’ll make a note of it and carry on with the lessons. Thankyou very much sir.

I’m answering for posterity to help other learners. The example uses an empty <th> to create a blank space in the upper left corner. This will create a table like below.


Just to add: I think the example mentions the empty TH for this reason:

The blank heading creates the extra table cell necessary to align the table headings correctly over the data they correspond to.

Which stumbled me up as well. Remove that empty TH and the lesson completes.
Perhaps the lesson/example needs updating.




 jlymann:

Remove that empty TH and the lesson completes.


The lesson may complete but the outcome will be a malformed table.

For all the beginners out there, I would like to tell you that you must add border=1 inside the  element in order to add a border to your table because if not you will not have a border for your table. Inside Codecademy it is added without border=1  outside it will not be added. Try and tell me.

remove the empty th and replace the scope with row 

You’ve added 4 headings and they’ve  only asked for 3 and I think you should add the heading tags without any attributes 

Yeah, but we are not up to that lesson. We don’t know what it Border=1  means. It’s not written in that part of the lesson. We shouldn’t be learning new tags/codes/etc from a forum, that’s the codeacademy’s job.

It says in the information to add  as an empty heading that aligns the columns in place.
        
That information was given as an example for our understanding whereas to complete that  section of the exercise you don’t have to add an 4th heading. To complete an exercise we’re bound to follow the instructions. That’s why you shouldn’t add attributes.  

Catower,
The answer that you gave, i found it out by actually “fiddling” around to see the effect of adding the empty header code and hence saw the output and accordingly corrected it myself.
I noticed that many of the questions related to the lessons on this portal are similar to this one…which in my view…could be avoided if, for example, in the lesson “Table Headings - Introduction to HTML, page 5/13” (to which this question is related).
In this lesson, the corresponding HTML code is shown as an example, the above table could also have been depicted below the HTML code for the benefit of the learners to understand how the output would look like once the HTML code is run.
Hence, in general, wherever HTML coding is depicted in the lessons as examples there should be a corresponding output of that coding shown in the lesson for a better understanding of what is taught in that lesson and this may minimise such questions on the forum. This in effect would help various levels of learners registered for various courses on this website.

Hello. Why can’t textarea element left blank


you can, why shouldn’t this be possible? Default text is really useful



 tegabainbridge931794:

When writing the code for a Textarea Element, why do you need to add the for, id, and name?


the for and id are used to associate the label and the element, the id can also be used for styling
the name is used form submission.

whats the big difference between id attribute and name atrribute

id is for styling and associating input element with label
name attribute is used when sending information to the back-end of your website.

are we learning back end in next section

no, that would be throwing you into the deep. Of course you ca google about form submission to get a general idea. be careful not to drown.

I have tried so many times but this is not working. 
Can someone please help!

Hey there !
You say to leave the alt attribute empty if it’s not needed. Does an image need an alt attribute (even empty) or is it possible to put only src and no alt attribute ?
Thanks !

It’s basically meant for screen readers. If there is no alt attribute the reader reads the full url, which is annoying.

Ok, it makes sense. Thanks !

I’m having trouble figuring out how to correctly add alt image attribute description - to the following code.

Where would this alt image attribute go?
When I place this attribute below the image source, the image description appears inpage to the right of the image and NOT when I mouseover the image as I think it should be.
Thanks -

<img src=""#"" alt=""A Brown Bear"" />

The alt attribute goes right after the image’s src.

Hey,
So I’m almost quite certain that this is a bug.  I added the <img src=""link"" alt=""A brown bear nonchalantly stares at you"" />, but when I hit “Run”, it keeps asking me if I entered the alt attribute…
The right side panel where it displays the output of the code is all of a sudden blank (only shows http://localhost:8000 at the top) and doesn’t load any of the code. This just happens when I’m inside this URL. When I go back a lesson it works fine, but without being able to complete this lesson, I cannot even proceed to the next by just skipping this one.
Edit: Was able to skip this error by clicking on “Solution”

4 posts were split to a new topic: Should alt show up when hovering?

There’s a bug with this exercise. You can bypass it by clicking solution.

I believe you should always include an alt attribute even if it’s alt="" "" for example if there is a description of the image, directly underneath it.

hey!
Just wanted to know what it means to put a # in src?
ex:- src=""#""

The # (hash) when written in the location bar means current page. It is often used as a placeholder when we are writing our HTML structure. Once that is in place we can fill in the missing URLs.
If we see a link like this…
<a href=""#"">Top of Page</a>

that tells us clicking the link will cause the page to scroll back to the top.

Addendum
Given we have a current page that means we can more closely define the hash to mean, “A fragment at this location”, which fragment may be the BODY, or any descendant of it.
Say we have a tag at the top of the page…
<nav>

and we give it an id…
<nav id=""top"">

Now that ‘to top’ link could look like this…
<a href=""#top"">Top of Page</a>

In what situation would I not use alt on an image?

Quite simply, when the image is window dressing with no content value (i.e., skin graphics, filler, random visual, etc.).
Another case is when textual content is represented in a graphic, and it is meaningful to the topic. For this element we would use the title attribute.
title=""textual content in an image"" 

In both of the above cases we would not leave off the alt attribute, but leave the value empty.
alt=""""

Add the  alt  attribute to the image and include a description. Make sure the description accurately describes the image.
someone can help me to add the ‘alt’ attribute? i don’t know where to go

Why are we able to have to inputs under the same label? How do they know to combine to each other?

The label identifies the element it is bound to. for is bound to id. Normal flow rules apply.

The input field changed size after I set the min=""1"" max=""10"" values. Why is that? Is that standard behaviour, or is there some css/js/something working here, that I cannot see?

In this exercise HTML method is “GET”, previously we have used only “POST”. What is the difference between them two and why in this case we are using “GET”?

You’ll find articles and videos on their difference in the following SERP…

https://www.google.com/search?q=GET+vs+POST


I understand that a label is connected to input via for and id attributes. But when we use a submit button, then that means using an input with the type=""submit"", so how does it connect to a label or to the input text field right next to it? I mean we click it and only the field right next to it responds. How does it happen?

Submit is a special type of input that triggers an event, onsubmit which then fires the handler. The handler parses the form data and builds a header for the request that contains all the fields assigned to the name we give them.
<input name=""info"" value=""user info"">

becomes,
info=""user info""

Because by default Submit has its own visual presentation and text, it does not need, nor should have a label. Only other inputs should have labels.

Hello! I have a question about step 8/14 from this lesson. We are prompted to create a label and input pair for new topping options. My question is more of an extension and not necessarily directly related, but I am wondering if there is a way to alphabetize these inputs in a way that doesn’t require that I restructure the code. So, ie., let’s say I’ve created 50 label and input  without thinking about alphabetization, could I write a simple ‘wrapper’ that would alphabetize them for me?




 rubymaster50043:

could I write a simple ‘wrapper’ that would alphabetize them for me?


If it is a static page, then simply arrange the items in alphabetical order. If it is a dynamic page then feasibly, yes, a script could be written to capture all the items, re-order them, then re-insert in the DOM. It won’t be that simple, though.

Confused. Why isn’t this working? what am I missing? I’ve added the input above the label below the
label…I’m not sure why its not working…it  should be the same as the previous code above it…? Someone help?
<section class=""topping"">
          <span>What toppings would you like?</span>
          <br>
          <!--Add your code below for the first checkbox-->
      <input id=""lettuce"" name=""topping"" type=""checkbox"" value=""lettuce"" >

          <br>
      <input id=""tomato"" name=""topping"" type=""checkbox"" value=""tomato"">
         <label for=""tomato"">Tomato</label>

Also did it this way...
`				<label for=""lettuce"">Lettuce</label>
            <input id=""lettuce"" name=""topping"" type=""checkbox"" value=""lettuce"" >
          <br>
         <label for=""tomato"">Tomato</label>
           <input id=""tomato"" type=""checkbox"" name=""topping"" value=""tomato""> 

but it still says Did you add the new <input> inside the correct <section> element?

A post was split to a new topic: What is the difference between GET and POST?

Hello!
While the course is discussing client-side validation, one of the use cases is “This can also help us protect our server from malicious code or data from a malicious user.”
Unfortunately, this is incorrect, and might give people the wrong idea (i.e. that client-side validation has use as a security measure).
All of the other examples are correct though, but I heavily recommend that this one gets reworded or deleted, as relying on client-side validation for any security will lead to issues.

Form Validation seems to have jumped right into ‘Requiring an input’ and covered a few topics, but there seem to be other stuff not explained like: action, method, value, etc.
When doing the quiz at the end of the lesson, there are question I don’t seem to have covered? Also, when checking the Cheatsheet there are alot of things listed not covered. Is it expected to Google and do a self study for this particular ‘Form Validation’?
"
179,"Can `name`, `value`, and `id` be the same? Should they be?","FAQ,HTML FAQ","forms,q-a",10,"
In the exercises shared for checkbox and radio buttons, the values provided for id and value attributes are always same. Is this a convention? Can the id and value attribute values be different?
","
The two attributes are in no way related. The id is purely a reference, whereas the value is what will be in the POSTDATA for that control, assuming there is a name attribute to pair it up with.
I’m quite out of date in terms of modern form handlers, but still feel pretty sure that id is not parsed when POSTDATA is constructed. It may well be, meaning if the control has an id, it wouldn’t need a name. I’d be suspect of this, though, and would give name precedence over id if the control has both attributes.
Bottom line, value is a field all to itself and is populated by the user who happens to be filling in the form, or preset if it is a checkbox or radio button.

Exercising “checkbox” attribute in an  element in a previous section I see that  a “class” in a  element and “name” attribute in the  element are same.
So, I thought that the reason for a same “name” attributes in the  elements is that the “group” is used in “class”.
this  “class” is different with “name” attribute in the  element.  I see that it is okay to be different between a class and a name attribute but I couldn’t understand the reason for the differences in the context of a previous exercise.
    <section class=**""cheesy""**>
      <span>Would you like to add cheese?</span>
      <br>
        <!--Add your first radio button below-->

      <label for=""yes"">Yes</label>
      <input id =""yes"" type='radio' **name='cheese**' value='yes'>
        <!--Add your second radio button below-->

      <label for=""no"">No</label>
      <input id='no' type='radio' **name='cheese'** value='no'>

The class attribute is a CSS hook (and possibly JS behavior) and in no way related to the name attribute.
Radio buttons only permit one selection from the group, hence they all have the same name attribute. It does not conflict with a class of the same name.
name attributes are associated with the user input of that control group.
POSTDATA = {
    cheese: 'yes'
}

what is the purpose of name attribute?

Suggest search for html attributes mdn. It will turn up a page that lists all the attributes recognized by HTML5, and if one digs deeper, all the attributes of earlier iterations of HTML.
Also suggest delving into form element mdn. That will turn up a description of the form and its attributes and child elements, known as controls.
It’s important that we understand the action attribute and how it relates to the submit type of user input.
Submit is a JavaScript event that triggers a request to the URL in the action attribute of the form opentag. The control data (values) is paired up with the name of the controls to create a key/value pair known as the POSTDATA which is then transmitted as a queryString appended to the request URL. The program at the other end of the request is known as the reqyest handler.
The request handler parses the POSTDATA it receives and usually stores it in a database,  but may even just parse it to a response page. Some form of response is sent back to the client to confirm the web transaction.
The purpose of the name attribute is to give a name to the value inputted by the user on that control so it gets properly entered into the query string of the request.

“To group radio buttons together, we assign them the same  name  and only one radio button from that group can be selected”
does this mean that in the checkbox we can use different names? is grouping just used for radio buttons?

Grouping can be used with both check boxes and radio buttons by giving them the same name. Multiple check boxes can be checked, whereas only one radio button can be selected.

thank you!!
another question  why don’t we write the content between the tags in datalist element as we did in select?

That would be question to ask W3C. The value attribute is a suitable place for it, though, since that what will be submitted with the form POST data.

180,How is the span element used?,"FAQ,HTML FAQ","forms,q-a",7,"
I have a question about the use of < span > tags in this exercise to nest the “Rare” and “Well-Done” text elements.  These tags are not really mentioned in the “Learn” section of the lesson, and while I remembered seeing them in the Elements and Structure lessons, I couldn’t quite remember their function.
I was unsure as to why they would be used instead of a < h1… > or < p > tags in this context, so I did a bit of research on all these tags.  First thing I found is that the < h1… > tags are not appropriate for anything that is not functionally a heading within your document - this is dictated by the best practices for readability and accessibility.  As to the < p > tag, the main reason it is not used here seems to be the BLOCK nature of the tag, meaning that each use of this tag to define an element would force a new line (this would also apply to the aforementioned <h1…> tags, as they are also BLOCK tags - err…I think). **edit - this would also appear to be why < div > is an inappropriate option here.
For the formatting of the type=range input to make sense in the example we need the text to remain INLINE. Thus, the < span > tag, which is not a BLOCK tag but an INLINE tag is selected.  However, in my research on the < span > tag, the most prevalent function for this tag seems to be sectioning off text for selective application of CSS style formatting rather than the structurally inline effect it has as an element (which I only saw mentioned once in a reply to a different question).
So after all that exposition, here are my actual questions:
Is < span > the only tag that is used for displaying inline text?
AND
If there are others, why is < span > the appropriate choice here?
","
What part f the cde creates the actual sliding bar

The actual sliding bar is created by the type attribute with the value “range”.
So if you use type=“range” it creates the sliding bar.
Hope it helped!




 hubris73:

Is < span > the only tag that is used for displaying inline text?


<span> is a generic inline container for phrasing content. It’s kind of like an inline version of <div>. It’s used to gain control of content inline for styling without changing the semantics of the content.
There are other elements that that have semantic meaning like <h1> for a heading but you can put a <span> inside an <h1> to control part of the content styling without changing the semantic meaning of the <h1>.
Here is a link to a list of inline elements:



MDN Web Docs



Inline elements
Inline elements are those which only occupy the space bounded by the tags defining the element, instead of breaking the flow of the content.





Here’s a reference link to the  element:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/span

when range input type is used, I found the label functionality for moving the focus to the input (when label is clicked) is no longer working. Is this a bug with the example provided or an exception with range type?

So I understand that we use <span> here, because we want to have an inline element without line breaks or anything like that. What I don’t understand is why there isn’t something similar to lable in behaviour. Maybe that comes later in the lecture.
I was just curious to see that we use a “generic” <span> for this. We could just have used a <span> to label the text and number fields earlier, but we used something better suited there: the <label>. Isn’t there an element that is clickable and for example brings the slider right over to that lable, or increases/decreases the slider by some increment?

Thank you!
Greatful for this concise and clear response.

181,How can main and header be used together?,"FAQ,HTML FAQ","semantic-html,q-a",15,"
I’m a little confused about where to use the <main> tag exactly?
According to the lesson text, they wrap all the content, except the <head> and <footer>, in the main tags, but then in the code editor, the <main> comes after the <header> tag, which to me seems like the more semantic way of putting it. So would have thought that it should go like this:
<header> 
    <h1>Types of Sports<h1> 
</header> 
<main>
    <article> 
        <h3>Baseball</h3>

a little confused about where to use the <main> tag exactly


Until we recognize which part of the dog is wagging what, this sort of mystery will prevail. <main/> is a semantic element. It comes from our demand. We insisted upon this element.




 mtf:

Don’t fully understand that, but are you saying that it dose not really matter where you put it? So its kind of up to the developer to decide what they think is better?
Kevin

HTML has evolved with the input from thousands of developers. Since it is the way we describe a document, it makes sense to have tags that fulfill that role.
header
main
footer

That pretty much describes the three component parts of a document, or article. A page can have several articles, each with these generic sections, or it can be a single article, with only one of each.
In the pre-HTML5 days it was common to see a page with three outer DIV elements,
<div id=""header""></div>
<div id=""main""></div>
<div id=""footer""></div>

We can see how the new elements evolved out of this, with the same intended purpose. Developers aim at giving meaning to markup, and semantic tags go a long way to supporting this objective.

Ah I see. Thanks for the reply.
So the way I said in my initial post was correct.
Thanks,
Kevin

Can we use header, main and footer tags multiple times inside of the body?
For example there’s a header and a main inside of the body and there’s also a header inside of the main tags.

Short answer, as you describe it, yes. Any section of a page can be considered a document body in its own right, thus affording it the full range of markup given its parent. We’re still beholden to the semantics involved, but that aside, the floor is open.
Given that document is the global object associated with the BODY (HTML, actually) it follows we cannot have more than one. Which element structure we choose therein is purely up to our imagination.

In addition to what @mtf and @zs-kev already said, here’s what I’ve found about this topic:
“The <main> tag specifies the main content of a document.
The content inside the <main> element should be unique to the document. It should not contain any content that is repeated across documents such as sidebars, navigation links, copyright information, site logos, and search forms.
Note:  There must not be more than one <main> element in a document. The <main> element must NOT be a descendant of an <article>, <aside>, <footer>, <header>, or <nav> element.”
https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_main.asp
With that being said, this is how I would do it:
<head>
	<title></title>
</head>
<body>
	<header>
	</header>
	<nav>
	</nav>
	<main>
	</main>
	<footer>	
	</footer>
</body>


I think there’s a misleading bit in 3/9 of this lesson, and zs-kev pointed it out.
Why didn’t anyone recognize what zs-kev was saying? I’ll repeat it:

In section 3/9 the lesson text/content shows a code example with header put inside main

In section 3/9 the code exercise has you put main after header.

We don’t need a philosophical digression pointing out that the tags are ‘for us to choose what to do with it’. All of you saying that are missing the point: the point is, what is the convention?
The convention is to put main after header, and so the section 3/9 lesson text/content is misleading.
Full stop. Fin.
Hope this helps.




 adamrgisom:

what is the convention?


The convention is to write well formed markup. There is no set way to compose a document. It is either valid (meaning it validates) or it is not.
A document may be sectioned in any number of ways. There is no limit on how many header or main or footer elements, other than that they cannot be repeated siblings. Nested sections can all have a header, main, and footer element. Even MAIN can have these elements.
Trying to find a black and white answer is not the way to view this. Markup that makes sense and validates is about all the convention you’re going to find.

I don’t exactly understand usage of main

There is no special usage apart from what the tag name suggests… The tag denotes the MAIN content of the page. It has no special behavior or style rules and is the same thing as a DIV. HEADER and FOOTER are much the same. The three tags combined help the author to show the principle page segments.
A page may contain multiple topics which can be denoted with ARTICLE or even SECTION, which are also the same as DIV. When the page is divided up into articles or sections, each one of them can also have a header, main and footer, as well as an H1.
Primarily, the different elements help us to give structure as they shape into an outline that is easier to follow and garner basic meaning. We can use whatever elements we want. There are no HTML police and the page won’t break. Semantic elements just lend themselves to readability.

That’s a great answer. Thank you!

HTML Police!   thats exactly what I feel sometimes:  there is a lobby of people judging someone’s else code  . OK,  so far if I got the main idea, generally in many projects we are gonna have the traditional:
<header </header> <main></main> <footer> </footer>
But also in real life it will be very contextual for your project and must be a consensus standard of your work team.

When we work as part of a team it is important that everyone follows the same generalized style guide. The best practice is to write well formed markup that validates, and read up on usability and accessibility practices that make our pages as usable/accessible as humanly possible.

I still can not figure out how to change the size of the font.
In  style.css , change the font size of all table headings and table data to 18 pixels.
When I tried to look at the solution, I saw no difference between the original and the solved version. Can anyone show me or explain better please?

Hi, I’ve been learning along with Codeacademy so please take anything I have to say with a grain of salt. Since there doesn’t appear to be any responses for you, I’ll try and help. By analysing other sections of the style.css file, I noticed there is information for font size as “font-size:16px;” for li.
I added this information to the “th, td” section and inputted the font size as 18px.
It worked so yeah.

Hi
Can you please tell me where I change the font size to 18 px? I tried, but at the bottom of screen it says Did you change the font size? I dont know where to do it?
Thanks for the help

You have to manually add font-size:
th, td {
  font-family: 'Lato', sans-serif;
  font-weight: 400;
  font-size: 18px;
  padding: 20px;
  text-align: left;

How do I indent the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, etc. rows of the paragraphs? I can simply press tab or add spaces for each rows but I’m sure this is not the right way to do it.
For e.g. in Microsoft word or Outlook emails, when I press tab to create an indent, the whole paragraph gets indented.

This is the error I get with the above code: “Did you add the given text inside your <p></p> tag?”

So you want to make the paragraph’s rows a little bit to the right:


Hello, and welcome on the forums, could you click  this icon on a new line, and write the code inside these ``` tags, because we can’t see it (because on the forums some HTML tags appear like on a website)

I think what you want is a hanging indent.
Try adding this attribute to the element: style=""padding-left: 20px;text-indent:-20px"".
If that doesn’t work, check out what this article says.

Ok , so a completely off-topic question here(Sorry ;-; )
I just realized that if I don’t use the  tags, it does not affect the program at all! Any idea why is it like this? I should have learnt things thoroughly in the beginning itself UwU ;-;

Do you mean the HTML tags like:
<h1>Hello</h1>

?

I see that the “ ” quotation mark is not recognized in  element.
Why is that?
<p>“Brown bears are not always completely brown. ” </p>

would screen only the letters. the quotations mark is not shown on the screen.
why is that???

same probs here, i already reload my browser, rewrite the code but still notifications like this… “Did you add the given text inside your  <p></p>  tag?”  appears every time i run the code…    a little help plzz… 

So I’m kind of stuck at the intro to HTML-Displaying Text part, and Ive tried over and over again to go on to the next section but i keep getting ‘‘Did you add a <p> tag in the introduction <div> ?’’
even if i copy the text, and even if i click the solution, copy it and reset the exercise then paste the solution and it still wont accept that as an answer…help!

0D6D2B60-5130-467C-80A6-B12FC51E4E18.png2048×1536 450 KB

I have a question. Please have a look at the above screen shot. Notice the error message, in red letters, on the bottom of the middle panel. It claims that I made a spelling error when it comes to typing the URL in the exercise. I have NOT made a spelling error when it comes to the URL. Now I can’t move to the next exercise.

And yes, I did use a closing >, it’s just that the error message is blocking the >.

You only have part of the URL in the image tag, here’s the full URL

https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/courses/web-101/web101-image_brownbear.jpg


Well formed code always has quote marks around all attribute values. Some attributes are boolean. They are an exception to this rule, only if written implicitly.
 <input type=""checkbox"" checked=""checked"">

 <input type=""checkbox"" checked>

Us old schoolers are pretty set on using double quotes in HTML attributes. I, for one prefer the consistency, even in script generated markup.
 let li = `<li id=""item${i}"">${item}</li>`

The above is an example of a line in a JS loop.

My course says I haven’t completed my task properly but I don’t know why?

image1897×959 331 KB


In line 28, the src attribute should be written with quotes around the URL to be well formed.
<img src=""%URL"">

Of course!
Thank you.

Does the image source address need to be in quotes? My code ran without it.

It’s more a question of convention than what the browser will allow. If we drill down to the core specs, quotes don’t matter in HTML 4. Attributes without quotes are just as valid. However, and that is a big, however, convention suggests that we never write unquoted attributes unless they are booleans.
<input type=""radio"" checked>

Makes sense! Thank you for the clarification.

Why must we make sure to wrap the link in quotation marks?

In the exercise we need to create just two rows, but what about a situation, when we want, for example, twenty of them? Is there some command, that helps to create a big amount of table elements without making it one by one?

2 posts were split to a new topic: How can I easily align opening and closing tags?

So I’m a bit confused as to why, when adding a table you put < th /th> and then to put something next to it in the next column its <td /td> underneath and then again <td /td> if i want to put yet another thing? How does the computer know that its the next one over? Why isn’t it always just <th or <td? Why does it change once and not again? Does it matter?
ex:
<table
   <tr
       <thBananas</th
       <td2</td
       <tdIn Stock</td
   </tr
</table

Is there an attribute that makes it so you have the “searchable” list but it does not allow freeform entry?  ie anything that isn’t in the list is not permitted?  I imagine you can do this with validation of the input by the next page but it would seem better for it to be possible to restrict it in the first place?  I can think of options (ie Country) where searchable is helpful but you don’t want freeform entry too?

What if i want to add an option of more than a word like that ?
< option value=nosauce>  < /option >
without make the form consider it as another attribute ?

Hi
 in the exercise dont have type=""text attribute as mentioned at the begining of this lesson and showed in the example but still display dropdown correctly. why?




 aresfl:

type=“text”


The default type is text, so we can leave off this attribute as it is moot.

Is the default always text - or can the default be changed?


https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/HTML5_input_types

Read the Previous page to that one, as well.

My browser is rendering the “value” inside the option, and the option itself. Because of that, datalist input is being displayed in an apparently duplicate way (just not the first letter in capital letter).
Is this a new browser rendering model? Are there any new practices to be adopted on this, if this is the new standard?

Why do we not have to add a closing datalist tag after the options?

I have a question. It is stated that certain web browsers work faster than others, because the request-response cycle from the server to the browser happens parallelly. How do they do it?

Hey Prodigy, How did everything come along for you when you started venturing into the mind of computer science and the HTML communication between server and client?
Personally, I think the URL is immediately scanned and creates a prime directive to instantiate any keywords that register as a data file on the server to run on command GET.
I would love to know what you found out.
I definitely need to get myself a good avatar or codeName. LoL

Hi all, fairly new to all this and I just have a question about the link for the files. does the + do anything between say “Semantic+HTML” or is that just how the file  path was named?
Also, on the previous exercise we covered some attributes that we can enclose in the media tags (,  etc). I was curious about the other attributes that we could use and the “crossorigin” attribute had some interesting values. Particularly the “anonymous” value. To me this could potentially cause a security flaw in the code, when would you use a value like this?
Lastly, I’m just starting with the basics of HTML and I’m not a paid subscriber (still evaluating if this is something I can really pursue) from anyone out there who is a paid subscriber, just how much am I missing out on with this course?

2 posts were merged into an existing topic: How to decide between video and embed?

Does anyone know why did they use the <source> tag in the <audio> tag? I tried adding the “src” attribute directly to the audio tag and it worked.
Can a media tag have multiple sources or what?

I switched to a paid subscription this week and like you wanted to see if I was able to code first before really investing money into something like this. There are lots of websites out there that are free to use that have similar content but I really like the style of this site and the projects they give you to cement what you have learned. I think you can’t access some content on the free version but you could use other sites in its place.

I’m confused by the src attribute’s placement. Can someone explain why it jumps all over the place for different elements. It’s in the opening tag of the <video> and <image> elements but needs a <source> element for <audio>? Why don’t we need a <source> element for <video> tags?

I’m not entirely sure, but I believe we choose <source> when we want to display more than one type of content. In this link there’s a good example of what I mean.
https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_source.asp
Not all browsers are compatible with every media format, so we use <source> to make sure various media formats are available to be displayed in case one of them doesn’t load.

In the embed code below why is there a / slash before the closing > ?


If you use the src attribute to link the audio file to the <audio> element, it will most probably work. However, not all browsers support the same audio file type. The <source> element is used to add multiple sources E.g. a .mp3 version and a .webm version. This will make your <audio> element accessible from all browsers

The HTML <source> element specifies multiple media resources for the  <picture> , the  <audio>  element, or the  <video>  element. It is an empty element, meaning that it has no content and does not have a closing tag. It is commonly used to offer the same media content in multiple file formats in order to provide compatibility with a broad range of browsers given their differing support for image file formats and media file formats. - MDN


In a way, convention. It is totally optional and can be ommited. However, I find it a bit confusing when not writing the “/” before the “>”

6 posts were split to a new topic: Can figure and figcaption be used for videos and gifs as well?

When using the figure element with an image, would we still use alt text withing the img tag, as well as figcaption to describe the image or would that be redundant?

I would say it depends on your caption. If the caption is going to be the same as alt or you are in a case where you cannot provide any Information in the alt attribute, then you can omit it.
Sometimes captions might not describe the picture, in which case an alt attribute should be added to describe the picture.

There is a semantic tag that could separate all media from all the code of HTML, like <nav> do with <anchors> that separate it from all the code, exist a tag that separates all media elements like img, gif, etc in a solo chunk?
Also is it a good practice to do this with <figure> semantic tag? 
image1366×768 87.6 KB


In this lesson you say:

Usually,  <figcaption>  will go inside  <figure> . This is different than using a  <p>  element to describe the content

I can’t understand what the difference between a “p” tag and “figcaption” tag except the semantic meaning.

figure position is independent of the document’s flow.

Can i get a little more explanation about this.

My understanding of the position being independent was that a figure is media that can be anywhere on the page, in other words, its location doesn’t impact its meaningfulness. Compare this to when you might use an img tag to put an image in a very specific place. If you go back and re-read the information for when an aside tag is applicable, it’s the same logic just for media instead of text.
As for the figcaption vs p question, I tried replacing it in the exercise and the only presentation difference was that p spaced the text further from the image. It might be possible that the only difference is the semantic meaning, I think that’s the undertone to this whole lesson.

So based on this does the  element count for metadata or is that only through the alt="" "" attribute?

I am not entirely sure, so maybe someone else could clarify.
Looking at it from my view, I would say that it could count for metadata only when the caption would be the same as your alt, as in that case, the alt is not required. If your caption does not describe the figure in any way, then I would say its not metadata as it does not provide any useful information about the figure, in which case the alt attribute would be a good option to include and that would become the metadata for the figure.

Thank you @zs-kev for the response.

It keeps saying that I’m using the wrong url but I literally copy and pasted the url it gave in the exercise. Can someone tell me what’s going on?
<figure>
  <img src=""https://content.codecademy.com/courses/SemanticHTML/dogimage.jpeg"">
</figure>

Something seems to be broken. I copy and pasted the solution into the exercise and it’s still throwing me an error.

Edit: nevermind what I wrote previously
It doesn’t look like you’re doing anything wrong, but the instruction validates on my end.
Just curious – which browser are you using?

I appreciate the response! No, it’s still throwing this error at me:
Error: Did you insert the correct link using the (src) attribute
Just saw your edit: Chrome



So this works on Firefox, but not Chrome apparently

I started turning extensions off and found out my Adblock extension was causing it to fail for some reason. I turned it off and pressed Run and it passed. Really strange. Hopefully this helps troubleshoot other people in the future.
Thank you for giving me some of your time!

Well played, awesome (but weird) fix!

Why we talk about semantic but if i inspect a random page of codecademy most of the time is used the “div” tag? Semantic is not really important?




 marcoboh:

Semantic is not really important?


We can still write semantic markup using only the HTML 4 elements as we always have. The new elements only make it easier to see what would be hard to spot semantics. We give meaning through structure, not just the tags we use.

What’s the difference between alt="""" and <figcaption></figcaption>?

Quite a lot, actually, though they are both connected to accessibility. alt="""" is an empty alternate text attribute that would appear in an <img> tag, and is left empty because the image has not particular relevance to the topic. It is essentially window dressing and we want screen readers and search engines to ignore it.
<figcaption/> on the other hand is not something we intend to have ignored. More the opposite. We want it to be seen and easily understood. It is a way to give an image a directly related caption so that search engines and screen readers can relate their relevance to the topic. This, and the <img> element would both be contained in the same <figure/> element. Before this element was added to the specification all we had was the title attribute and an associated <p/> element which could be wrapped in the same DIV or LI.

why doesn’t this code work like it should? The Codeacademy logo appears to be like words on a page so when i scroll over it I have the ability to highlight. I click on it and it isn’t very fast in response. It appears to be flashing the flower.png instead of appearing upon a click.

The first time you click there will be a delay while the image is downloaded. After that it is instant.

I haven’t seen any instant reactions. is this due to my browser compatibility or wifi connection?

I’m getting instant responses when clicking directly on the word. There may be some latency on the first click, but after that the image is cached in your browser and should pop right up, or right out.

Where that “normal” in -   if (image.src.match(“normal”)) { - comes from? Does “normal” refer to “normal.png”? Sounds to me  like juggling with words - if normal–>flowers, else—> normal.

.match()  just checks if “normal” is present  in the current image src attribute.
If not present it returns null.
So everytime onclick ,
   if  ""normal"" is present in current img src attribute,
          image will be changed to   flower.png
   else 
          image  will be changed to normal.png.

In other words,
everytime onlcick image src attribute is changed either from flower.png to normal.png or vice versa.
Hope this helps.

In JavaScript Interactive Websites attribute async, I am not seeing the effect of the async attribute, I added to the turnBlue.js . the codeacademy logo is still pink. can someone explain why

I guess according to the explain, the Codeacademy logo is supposed to be yellow but it starts with pink.
@oreva20 I saw the logo in blue once after hit the run many times

yes, I did see the logo in blue once.

I think that the CSS file is loading AFTER the scripts are run.  I think that is why we are seeing pink.

In this exercise, THE SCRIPT ELEMENT: Async attribute, I see that the file style.css comes first than the file turnBlue.js inside the HTML document. If, as it was said before, the HTML parser, analyzes the document sequentially, why does .css prevail over .js?

A CSS document will probably be lighter than a JS script so rather have your site looking as it should before rolling out animations and whatever else maybe in your js file.
So js will take longer to load which would delay your whole site, if the HTML & CSS is loaded first then there is no unnecessary delays.

I would think that defer works even better because what if the script is downloaded so quickly that before HTML parsing the actual , it’s been executed before HTML parser start rendering CSS file.
Then in this case the final rendered result is derterminated by CSS.

@zainabrawat, I think rui_melim, by saying



 rui_melim:

why does .css prevail over .js


He may be referring to the fact that, as long as we don’t add async, the logo never turns blue. At least that’s how it behaves for me. I tried running the code before adding async and the logog remained pink, as if the .js script was never executed - or it was, but the CSS styling somehow  got the upper hand? Also when I remove the async attribute and run the code again, the logo turns back from blue to pink.

196,Why do we need the tag after the declaration?,"FAQ,HTML FAQ","elements-structure,q-a",14,"
Why do we need the  tag after the  declaration? This seems redundant. We tell the browser that it is dealing with an html file via the Doctype declaration; then we have to tell it again with the  tag once it starts parsing the code? Can the function of  tags not be passed off to the DTD?
","
The DTD is not HTML, but SGML. It tells the user agent that the root element of the document is <html></html>. The de facto namespace is HTML5. Other than that the declaration has no part in DOM.

Hey there, just started learning html but like Nathan here, I feel a redundancy in the writing. I’ve been reading your reply a couple of times but I’m still confused. I’m sure your answer is probably clear to most people here but if you were to bring it down a level from newbie 2.0 to newbie 1.0, what would it look like? Thank you


 3 On SGML and HTML

The above refers back to HTML 4.01 as it relates to SGML. HTML is a subset of SGML.
With the advent of HTML5 and the present day Living Standard a lot of the technical boilerplate was shooed into the background, such as the long and complex DTD and namespace declarations; and a number of meta data components such as ‘content-type’, etc. were made moot. That’s where the de facto aspect comes in.
<!DOCTYPE html>

Looks like an HTML comment, almost, doesn’t it? But it is not HTML, only an HTML DTD to declare the root element of the document. That is where the real HTML begins.
<html lang=""en"">
  <!-- everything in here is HTML -->
</html>

mark <body< and win the coding winning storke

Hello newbie 1.0 , as a member of the newbie 2.0 squad myself, i totally understand you. So I hope this helps: As you know,  is not a HTML tag, but rather, just a message to the web browser telling it what it’s looking at and dealing with. On the flip side, thing  tag serves as a container, this ‘container’ serves as a ‘bracket’ (for lack of a better word. What this bracket does is tell the web browser that the opening and closing  tags are where all related  code will begin and end. I hope this helps. Cheers




 mtf:

But it is not HTML, only an HTML DTD to declare the root element of the document. That is where the real HTML begins.


Hi, Roy. I am still confused about the concept of DTD. I heard that HTML 5 is not based on SGML, so there is no requirement to quote DTD. And Here is what I find in the Stackoverflow say that there is no HTML5 DTD( DTDs have been regarded by the designers of HTML5 as too limited in expressive power, and HTML5 validators (basically the HTML5 mode of http://validator.nu and its copy at http://validator.w3.org/nu/) use schemas and ad hoc checks, not DTD-based validation. Moreover, HTML5 has been designed so that writing a DTD for it is impossible. ). This is completely confusing for a newbie 1.0 like me.
Could you please elaborate on the relationship between DTD and HTML 5? AND what is the role of the DTD in detail?




 css8888791793:

Could you please elaborate


No. I think you’ve done enough already in terms of following up on the details to arrive at a conclusion.
However, DTD is SGML, not HTML. The current one is the compromise. No DTD can be used to describe HTML5. but we can describe the root element, html.
<!DOCTYPE html>

and then rely upon the local namespace to provide all the support, which is what is happening.
Don’t forget that HTML5 is XML compliant, which as it happens does include the DTD since modern XML has absorbed SGML. What we have is an XML document that gets defaulted to text/html if not specified otherwise.




 mtf:

but we can describe the root element, html .


Doctype declaration <!DOCTYPE html> tells the user agent that the root element of the document is  <html></html> . Is this redundant? Cuz it is very obvious that <HTML> </html> is root element.
AND what is the relationship between SGML and HTML 5? I know that XML is a simplified modification of SGML, and SGML is the parent of XML and HTML.




 css8888791793:

Cuz it is very obvious


No it’s not. A malformed page would suggest that the first element encountered is the root element. This is a necessary declaration.



 css8888791793:

what is the relationship between SGML and HTML 5?


XML




 mtf:

XML


could you please talk more specifically? 




 css8888791793:

more specifically?


Again, no. It’s a long and windy road that needs some serious perusing of W3 pages, and all its internet accoutrements.

Anyway. Thank you. I still have a lot to learn

The spacing between code in an HTML file doesn’t affect the positioning of elements in the browser. If you are interested in modifying the spacing in the browser, you can use HTML’s  line break element:  <br> .
What about single spaces? Don’t those affect the positioning of words in an HTML file?

So for  we had to do, it was a paragraph with two breaks in it to seperate two different sentences…
At the end of the lesson I played with the code. The section of output text looked the exact same when I did two breaks () in the paragraph, and when I seperated the text by creating two 's.
My question is, if the  and seperate  can give the exact same results, then why use  cause imo it’d just made the back-end code look messy and unorganized…

Why do we use double line break tags in our code, when individual paragraphs does the exact same task?

why use br when I can just use two pairs of p ?

I wonder the same thing too

Is there a way to do multiple line breaks, instead of repeatedly typing <br>?

Really good question. The answer is related to the another API connected to the DOM, the Cascading Style Sheet. This is where we can define elements in any way we choose. That gap you want? We give something a margin to suit.
If CSS has not yet come up, then hold your horses and keep up with the lessons. It will.

The line break tag can be used to add a line break within the paragraph?

Yes, that would be the most likely place to use it if you don’t wish to start a new paragraph.

Neither of them look “clean” to me when nesting, so I want to know so others may be able to better read it.

Neither of them make a difference since white space is largely ignored by the parsing engine. For textual content use as many line breaks as you need to make the text easy to read and see without scrolling right or left.
<p>Its conservation status is currently 
<strong>Least Concern</strong>.<br><br>

<p>The Nile River is the longest river
 <br> in the world, measuring over 6,850 
<br> kilometers long (approximately 4,260
 <br> miles).</p>

When I go to do the same in the exercise, it is telling me it is incorrect:
<strong>Least Concern</strong>. 
     <br>There are many subspecies within the brown bear species,
     <br>including the Atlas bear and the Himalayan brown bear.</p>```




And then states this is the solution:
<strong>Least Concern</strong>. <br><br>
There are many subspecies within the brown bear species,including the Atlas bear and the Himalayan brown bear.</p>```

What am I missing?
Thanks!

Notice the two back to back breaks rather than one after the comma.

Can i put breaks between images?
The exercise displays the image of the brown bear and the video below it but both are touching, how can i space them apart?

A <video/> element is block level and can have margins. A simple matter of giving it one, say, 10px.
video {
    margin: 10px 0;

how does adding learn more to an anchor element make the whole thing a hyperlink. i thought it was supposed to be  just the anchor element and the href attribute

the text between the anchor opening tag and anchor closing tag is the text a user on your website can click on, the moment a user does this, they will be redirected to the route specified at href.

question


Is it possible to create a link and not make it look blue?? It looks bad sometimes.

yea, we can use css to style anchor elements. That is perfectly possible

What’s the difference between “src” and “href”?

Great guide for mine. Very useful for SEO.

Hey, I’m starting coding now and I am currently on the linking exercise. Codecademy makes it seem like we can only link articles with HTML code, Is this true or false?

Hi,
Welcome to the forums and Good Luck on your learning journey 



 tag6966515537:

Codecademy makes it seem like we can only link articles with HTML code, Is this true or false?


No you can link anything; from a page in the same directory (folder), to other websites, anything that has a link. As you go along you will learn and use more practical examples.

Two questions
firstly can we use src attribute in place of href(i know we can’t, but i’m curious as to the details seeing as they are not too different).
secondly when they were describing href they said “the paths are often URLs”, what else can be anchored with href apart from URLs.




 digitalplayer38670:

firstly can we use src attribute in place of href(i know we can’t, but i’m curious as to the details seeing as they are not too different).


html has a lot of underlying code, so its not as simple as it seems on the surface
we can use ids like so:
<a href=""#first"">jump</a>

to jump to a element with id first on the same page

I have a question. Can we use the href attribute for images that would lead to sites. And if yes, can you please show me an example of how it would look like?

then you would have to wrap the image in anchor tags (<a>)

It refused to accept my input of  Learn More. and when I finally gave up (after reading forum and looking at hints) the solution had the url in it – step one specifically says “don’t enter url ”…

201,What is the purpose of Video Not Supported?,"FAQ,HTML FAQ","elements-structure,q-a",12,"
why the “Video not supported” is placed between the opening and closing of the  tag ?
","
I can not find a way to alter the video tag attributes so that the message “Video not supported” is shown. I only get the broken video placeholder in the same width and height that are specified in attributes. What must be done to see the text?

I am unable to complete the Video Not Supported section of the HTMl Video section. It looks exactly like the example, just with the text the exercises want.
</video src=“https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/courses/freelance-1/unit-1/lesson-2/htmlcss1-vid_brown-bear.mp4” width=“320” height=“240” controls>
Video Not Supported
<//video>
The duplicate /'s is there so you can see the actual text, and not the outcome of my text.

Did you ever get a reply or figure this out?  I am having the same issue.  Even went so far as to copy and paste thinking I messed up the address.

This question was asked, but not answered. Why do we put “video not supported”?

This also happend to me. It says "" within the brackets"" When you had to place it out of the brackets. they need to be more dicriptive .

This text will only show up if your browser cannot render the video. For the purposes of this exercise don’t worry about seeing it, as all the modern browsers should be able to load the video. Finally remember the text needs to be between the tags like so:
<video>
Video not supported</video>


The text “Video not supported” is called a fall back in case the browser cannot play the video ( in a case of obsolete browser) or poor network.

You have an unnecessary / at the beginning of the code - </video src… and an extra / at the end

I am unable to see “Video not Supported”, even after the video fails to load due to bad URL provided by me.

I had the same issue but I came here and saw that Ajax4365… answered in early April. It seems it’s primarily meant for old/obsolete browsers unable to playback.

Hi there!
While the course so far has been completely understandable can I ask you to explain why the explanatory code also contains th elements within the body, whereas the previous task contained the information that The  <tbody>  element should contain all of the table’s data, excluding the table headings?
Thank you in advance.
Greetings,
Ben

I sorta have the same question. does <thead> only contain column <th>, and <th> related to rows can only be included inside <tbody>?

I have the same question

Hi everyone!
From my understanding, when adding the  element shouldn’t change anything visually.
But, for me, it changes that section to light blue and changes the text style.
When I remove the  element, it goes back to normal.
Is that supposed to happen?
Maybe I didn’t read that part of the lesson correctly.



Same here. It may be to do with CSS. Is that correct? I was wondering how it is possible to to the same with horizontal headers(or row headers)? Is it to do with the scope attribute?

I have the following question, why I can’t just use the “scope” attribute inside the  (or <tbody,  - depending) and give the value “col” or “row”. Like this:


i often made this mistake thinking  and  to be same because they are different…

It says that the value of the input element is changed.
Where can I see this value? Where is it sent?

What will be the default value for the step attribute in the input element if I don’t enter the step attribute at all? Also what are the default values for the max and min attributes?

When you set the max number, what does the number translate in terms of its output on screen? For example, if I set the max to 10, is it like 100 pixels away from the origin? Or is it just an arbitrary number?

While adding a range input, I was wondering if there’s a way to mark the value of gradations?
eg  
image966×222 21.9 KB


A bit unrelated but when I added a min and max to the amount of patties you can have the text displayed changed even though there was no actual text added. why is that?

What determines where the dot for a slider starts? In the example of the Volume and the exercise for “doneness” the dot starts out in the middle. Is there a way to make start on the left or right the range?

I think we can adjust slider without step attribute 0.5, by giving the range 0 to 10 rather than  0 to 5  with step attribute 0.5. Both have same affect. Is there another use of step attribute?

Hi Pulkitsinga i had the same question about the default value for the step attribute and after  playing around it seems the step default is 1. Using attributes min=“0” max=“5” step=“0.5”
allows the range slider to select 10 positions in increments of 0.5, whilst this min=“0” max=“5” with the step attribute omitted, allows the range slider to select 5 positions in increments of 1.

Hi Yasir the max value of the range slider is 100, we could use the step attribute for more precise increments in, say, a seek bar for a long audio track.
Josh

Hi Data use the value attribute to determine the starting position of the ‘thumb control’ in the range slider. For example where value=“3” min=“1” max=“5” the control will default to start position 3 of 5 positions (with 1 being furthest left and 5 being furthest right), which is the middle of the range slider. We can use min=“0” also which is useful for when we need a zero value like for volume control on audio players. The max attribute’s maximum value is 100, if we need more increments we can use the step attribute.
Josh

i think this is optional right now but may be compulsory to use in some other conditions in upcoming elements … let see

2 posts were split to a new topic: How can you indent multiple lines all at once?

In the Table Body exercise, the site states "" The  <tbody>  element should contain all of the table’s data, excluding the table headings (more on this in a later exercise)."" excluding, but then it proceeds to use the <th> tag within the <tbody> tag. Is this just a mistype, or is there an explanation why in the example we’re allowed to use the <th> tag within the <tbody> tag? If we genuinely aren’t allowed to include the <th> within the <tbody> tags, where would we put them?

Data columns and rows can have headings, too, hence TH is used in the first row and the first column, instead of TD. When TH is used in the THEAD, it usually spans the entire table as a single, main heading for the table.

The exercise says: Enclose rows 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 of the table in a <tbody> element.
However, the table does not have that many rows.

Funny, I count eight rows in all.

This was my issue too. I don’t think this task is particularly clear for anyone who is anyone who is a true beginner.

I think this task could’ve been explained a little clearer. I don’t see anything other on my screen than the cells we just created in the previous task, and as an absolute beginner wasn’t sure if we’re suppose to find the 6 rows from the code or the ones we see on the page. I just got it right but it still doesn’t make much sense to me yet.

form action=""/practice.html"" method=“post”

p> Davie’s Food Menu</p
</form
My question is… Is h1 and p siblings and child of form? or is p child of h1 and grandchild of form ???
Note the example above  doesn’t have the right open and close tags because it modifies my text 
I still don’t understand how it works … Thanks

I believe from what you’ve described that <h1> and <p> are siblings, and are children of your <form> element. To format your code so that it will display properly in the forum, go to a blank line, click on the </> button in the menu bar above where you type. You will see this:

Paste your code in the space indicated, and we will see it with its original formatting and special characters preserved.

hello @midlindner … thanks for the tip … now I know how to use a piece of code to display between my text… Haha… got love learn this things! 
Appreciate your help!




 midlindner:

click on the </> button


What is the button to which you refer? I see no buttons anywhere, and always just type all of the code myself.  I’d love a shortcut, as I have seen in some of the videos.

Above the text box that you type in, there should be a few icons to format your response (including B and I – bold and italics). The 6th icon is the </> which will let you input your code! Hope this helps!

Even I had difficulty in understanding it, thanks @aranishanker for clarifying further. 

Hi,
I do not see these icons above my textbox. Any chance you can take a screenshot to show me?

For those having a hard time with regular expressions, I’d recommend https://regexone.com/
It’s an interactive tutorial to teach you the basics of regular expressions. The tutorial could have been better, but it’s more approachable than the overwhelming complete list of regular expressions as in the MDN documentation.

Why are we not using the “+” modifier/identifier in the Credit Card Value regex??  Shouldn’t those numbers also occur one or more times as “+” indicates? Or is it written this way purely because the photo shows each number only used once??

7 posts were split to a new topic: Why is a credit card number using type text?

How would you mandate a certain number of numbers, letters, uppercase letters, or characters in a username or password? For example, “password must include 1 uppercase, 1 lowercase, 1 number, and 1 special character”.
Also, are these patterns something the coder creates? Or is there a set of patterns to follow? How do you build a pattern? This was probably answered in the regex article, I had a hard time following it, super new to coding.

I’m not quite sure what the purpose of the aside code if for…it doesn’t make a difference to the text when I run the code. Can someone better explain to me the use of this code?

I believe we normally combine it with CSS styling to separate it or differentiate from the main body of the text.

Can the aside go inside the article tag?  e.g:
<main>
      <section>
        <article>

216,What order do attributes need to be in?,"FAQ,HTML FAQ","forms,q-a",10,"
Is there a best practice for the order of attributes in an  element? Sometimes it seems to start with “id”, other times with “type”. As a beginner it would be helpful to just adopt a standard practice for it.
In other exercises the order was type, id, name… In this exercise it:s the opposite.
Also why doesn’t the code I was trying to paste here as an example not appear? Thanks
","
From what I’ve seen the order doesn’t matter, but I guess consistency within your own code is good so I think it’s up to you.
If you mean posting your code in this textbox here you need to surround it with this: ` on each side for it to appear. Or use three of those for a block.
Single wrapping, like this: <input>
Or block wrapping with three of those, like this:
<input type=""text"" id=""some"" name=""some"">
<label for=""some"">Some text</label>

Just look up formatting help.

Is there a best practice for the order of attributes in an element?


The document (HTML) is an object which attributes (elements) are also objects. Think of an HTML element being represented in the DOM as,
p-node = {
    'opentag': '<p>',
    'id': '',
    'className': '',
    'style': {
        'width': '100%',
        'height': 'auto',
        'margin-top': '1em',
        'margin-bottom': '1em',
        'font-size': 'inherit'
    },
    'endtag': '</p>'
}

not an exact representation
The order in which object attributes are written is of no special concern as objects are not ordered the way an array is.
If one has blue eyes, blond hair, fair complexion, height of 6ft, weight of 175lb, does it matter what order this description is written? No matter what order the attributes are written they still apply.
person = {
    height: 6ft,
    weight: 175lb,
    hair-color: blond,
    eye-color: blue,
    complexion: fair
}

Thank you. I understand now that the order is of no special concern, but it seems that there are other situations where there are “best-practices” that are followed, even if the code will function without following those best-practices. So I was wondering if there existed a best-practice for the order in this example…

Best practice relates more to consistency, as @karolisvaitkevicius6 pointed out. For instance id could be written before class or name, to help it stand out. href could be written before rel, and src before alt, but it won’t matter which way you choose. Just keep it consistent in your markup.

One way to go, though I’m not sure if this is an accepted practice, is  alphabetization. Something like:
<input id=""guess""
       max=""10""
       min=""1""
       name=""guess""
       required
       type=""number"">

Consistency in your code is important, but most rules are easy to forget other than alphabetization. That’s my opinion.
For CSS properties, alphabetization is an accepted practice, as recommended by Google.

Great, thank you! Good to know

in the forms exercice , does the input have to follow a specific order or not because in the learn box there is :
input id=“guests” name=“guests” type=“number” min=“1” max=“4”
while in the index box we have ;
<input type=“number” name=“guess” id=“guess” required min=“1” max=“10”
so the type=“number”  is once written at first then in the middle …

In the hint, it says, “Make sure you add the attributes to the opening tag, the ordering of the attributes in the opening tag doesn’t matter.” So, I do not think the ordering of the attributes inside the opening  tag matter. Does that help?




 karolisvaitkevicius6:

From what I’ve seen the order doesn’t matter, but I guess consistency within your own code is good so I think it’s up to you.


So, from what I understand, there is no convention to the order of attributes on an element. It is merely a developer’s decision to stay consistent with the ordering? Personally I think it is a good idea to keep element-specific attributes (ex. type= for <input> or for= for <label>) toward the front of this list, followed by global attributes (ex. class= and id=), and so on. I guess this could be referred to as attribute… specificity?

217,Can you use a mix of semantic and non-semantic HTML?,"FAQ,HTML FAQ",semantic-html,5,"
Can you use a mix between non-semantic and semantic HTML?
","
Hi @frank2906 
Sure, you can definitely mix semantic and non-semantic HTML.
However, as stated in the codecademy lesson, using semantic HTML gives many perks to the web page, such as:

Readability: a semantic html code is more complete, better organized, easier to understantd and mantain for other delevopers;
Improved accessibility: visually impaired users who utilize screen readers to visualize the web page;
Better SEO ranking: when crawlers analyze a web page and find meaningful, organized content, it will translate into a better SEO ranking for the web page.

For example, think about div and section elements. We could use both for our web page but, while the first has no semantic meaning and simply marks up a block, the latter has semantic meaning and describes its content.
Hence, for the reasons explained above, web developers are encouraged to use section over div. The latter should be used for styling purposes and generally as a last resort element. Hope the example helps you clarify this topic.
If you want to read more about HTML Semantic Elements: https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp
Excuse me if I made grammar errors but english isn’t my mother language 

Sorry for a late reply, but thank you! Also your English is absolutely flawless.

Odd, but it makes sense.

The lesson described this idea pretty well, it might clear up any confusion with which you regard semantics as odd, rather they are quite useful!
Introduction to Semantic HTML:

To better understand this, you can think of comparing non-semantic HTML to going into a store with no signs on the aisles. Since the aisles aren’t labeled, you don’t know what products are in those aisles. However, stores that do have signs for each aisle make it a lot easier to find the items you need, just like Semantic HTML.

I am really confused about the instruction to add an empty src to the script tag.  When I do it gives me the error message that the src must have a value.  What have I done wrong?

It may well be that a console error is tolerated for this exercise, and will be rectified in a following lesson. Albeit that the case, a hash is an acceptable URL to the browser.
src=""#""

I followed the steps, got all the check marks but in the end, it doesn’t work.

The script has been left commented out, for some reason. In script.js remove the comment tokens, /* at beginning, and */ at the end. Click Run to save. Now click the browser window repeatedly.

True and I did uncommented it. Well, actually what I did was to remove only the first “*/” and left the last. I didn’t show me any error message as I kept tying to make it work. It’s working now. Thanks!

Why should I use this syntax src=""./exampleScript.js"" rather than src=""exampleScript.js""?
It works fine with the second one.

In your case, ./ isn’t needed since that file is on the same level as the current directory that you are in. For example, if you wanted to enter or access a file that was one directory higher, you would use …/ which would bring you up a directory and into that file. I hope this helped! 




 jnijnijni:

./ isn’t needed since that file is on the same level as the current directory that you are in.


But it does tell the reader that in OS terms.

Thanks Johnny. I already know path syntax rules 

In the example in src attribute lesson, what is the difference between making an assignment of value to elem.style.color before the switch statement and after it?

As someone who has written a bit of Html, what are some specific things you tend to leave comments on both for yourself and/or others?

I use it as a kinda of pointer. So when I create a new div which I’m going to put content in, I’ll put a comment saying what I’m using it for, like so:
<!-- Div for updating score-->
<div id=""score"">
Score: 0
</div>

It’s a nice pointer for me or other people to see as the scroll through the code, Oh hey, that’s where that div is and that’s what it does.

Thanx for the reply @stevencopeland I was thinking much the same way! It would be super useful for labeling containers and things of that nature. I’m just now starting out and hoping maybe I will get some input from experienced devs that may show other useful ways to use these comments that shed light on instances that my inexperienced self might use down the road to avoid problems. Comments seem like a very versatile tool.

Hey,
I work in a Japanese company (and plan on opening my own up here soon !!) But I was wondering with the <!-- comments thing, can you use other languages in there? Some of my coworkers can’t speak English well enough to suddenly be leaving English comments in the code.
Thanks

It’s important to keep in mind that your comment can be read in the page source by anyone accessing the site, so don’t leave any sensitive information in comments.

Once finished, if site users inspect the code of the site, will they be able to see all of the comments in the code?

While you are writing the code, there are certain practice that needs to be developed.
For example:
What is something new you learnt while creating that code.
What is something that your code does and is a little but clever.
Is there a point in your code where you got stuck!
This is the part of the code I need to update regularly.
This part of the code needs to be revised or updated.
These examples would make you insert the comments at places which would be easier for you and others as well.

226,How do I link my CSS stylesheet to HTML file?,"FAQ,HTML FAQ",,11,"
Question
How do I link my CSS stylesheet to HTML file?
Answer
You can insert this tag in the <head> section of your HTML file:
<link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""file-path-to-your-css-file"" />

In order to determine what the filepath to your css file is, you need to determine where your html file is relative to your css file. Consider the four scenarios (NOTE: folderName and cssFilename are the names of your folders and css file):

Your css file is in thesame folder as your html file.
Then your file path will be: ./cssFilename.css

Your css file is inside another folder that is in the same folder as your html file.
Then your file path will be ./folderName/cssFilename.css
If your css file is nested in more than one folder, then add another /folderName until you get to your file.
Your css file is in another folder outside your html file.
Then your file path is: ../cssFilename.css
If your css file is in multiple folders outside your html file, then you will add a ../ for every folder that is outside.
Your css file is inside a folder that is outside your html folder.
Then your file path will be ../folderName/cssFilename.css.
Here, you’ll be using a combination of 2 and 3.

Isn’t the 3 & 4 are the same??   By the way I am win10 user…In my pc 3 and 4 doesn’t work perfectly

This is the no2 u r showing…Show the example of 3 and 4 where css file stored in completely different directory

can i get a more specific explanation as to how ing works? say i’m styling an existing, running, operating website. if i link it via directory/relative path rather than hyperlink, wouldn’t every person using my website need to be on my computer where said directory is stored for the link to work? wouldn’t it fail to work on other computers since the browser will process the link to search for the file/directory and it will lead nowhere because on their device no such file exists?
or does something else occur that i, the person creating the link from my own computer files, cannot see when making my stylesheet? as in, when i link to a file, does it not direct the browser to look for the file in the computer, but instead upload said file’s data somewhere online (server? maybe? is that anything?)/in my code, hidden from view to me, the programmer, and to the audience looking at the website?
i hope i’m clear enough. i’m just on the first lesson of CSS so this might be real noob stuff, and i could go on without fully understanding it i guess, but i want to. thanks

It works just fine with or without the “./” initial characters… so what’s the difference, what are those for?
Thanks

./ denotes that the file/folder you are linking to is in the same directory as the current document. ./ can be omitted, however, I find it a bit confusing when it’s not there
Both href=""style.css"" and href=""./style.css"" are correct

When you deploy a website, you are uploading all the files/folders needed to make the website work. This includes your index.html, your style.css, etc. When the user agent is rendering your index.html, it will get instructed to apply the styles in the external stylesheet (the style.css). It will try to find the stylesheet in the location you specified in the href of the <link> element. If you haven’t changed the location of your stylesheet, it will be able to find it in the files/folders you uploaded.
Before you deploy a website, all the files/folders needed to render the website properly are stored locally. However, when you deploy a website, all those files/folders will be hosted somewhere. E.g. GitHub Pages, Heroku, Netlify, AWS, etc.

Please and thank you!

What do you mean? Please explain throughly.

Sorry about that.
In the lesson:
The  <label>  element has an opening and closing tag and displays text that is written between the opening and closing tags. To associate a  <label> and an  <input> , the  <input>  needs an  id attribute. We then assign the  for  attribute of the  <label>  element with the value of the  id attribute of  <input> “
What is the ‘for’ attribute, well… for? What does it do?
And why does the ‘for’ value have to be the same as the ‘id’ value?
I don’t know why I’m having such a hard time with this particular lesson…

I suggest you check out this article so that you can understand labels. Hopefully you will understand.
Happy coding! 




 tag2490142526:

And why does the ‘for’ value have to be the same as the ‘id’ value?


Because this way, the browser knows which label is associated with which input field. Which is needed for screen readers (for people with poor vision for example)

Why we need <label>  in this example

<form>
  <label for=""user-password"">Password: </label>
  <input type=""password"" id=""user-password"" name=""user-password"">
</form>


We can eliminate the <label>
> <form>
>   Password: <br>
>   <input type=""password"" id=""user-password"" name=""user-password"">
> </form>

Why would we want to make a label rather than just put regular text around the input? It seems like it would be the same. Do we do anything with the label?
For example, why is

better than

?

From https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Label

Associating a <label> with an  <input>  element offers some major advantages:

The label text is not only visually associated with its corresponding text input; it is programmatically associated with it too. This means that, for example, a screenreader will read out the label when the user is focused on the form input, making it easier for an assistive technology user to understand what data should be entered.
You can click the associated label to focus/activate the input, as well as the input itself. This increased hit area provides an advantage to anyone trying to activate the input, including those using a touch-screen device.


You wouldn’t benefit from all this using <p>Username</p>, for example.

is label like a semantically correct version for p in the context of declaring what the 's purpose is?

doesn’t @ghostlovescore answer cover your question?

Why do I have to assign the label to input if the label acts just like a heading? You see if i remove for="""" it doesn’t make a difference the text inside  still acts the same.

The for associates the label with the input field. This is needed for accessibility tools. So that your website can also by used by people who have poor(er) vision and things like that.




 nejentsg5780946248:

You see if i remove for="""" it doesn’t make a difference


It depends how the label element is used. If it wraps the input control, it doesn’t need for since the control is a child element. If it appears before (or after) the input control then it does need for to declare the association.
<label for=""name"">Name: </label>
<input id=""name"">

Run that in your browser. Mouse over the label and click. Notice anything? We’ve given focus to the input control just by clicking the label. This is a huge boost for usability and accessibility.

What is the class element and what do the different attributes do?

lets say we have 10 divs, and we want to style 5 of them, we can give these 5 divs classes so we can target them in css
different attributes allow us to customize different elements. What each attribute does, you can check in online documentation (MDN is good)

Can datafeeds fro tables created with HTML be from a backend database, e.g customer orders rather than inputed manually?

if the table contains input elements, then yes, depending on your back-end language you might need to give the input elements a name with value of array, for example:
<input type=""text"" name=""email[]"">


Why if I delete the CSS part in the head the image in the unordered list isn’t shown?

For this exercise I was intrigued as to how to make the menu bar look the way it does. It looks different to the simple text menu in the last tutorial. Is that done using css?

Hey @timtamtom1, welcome to the forums!
Yes, the menu bar is made with CSS. If you haven’t learned that already, CSS is the way most developers use to style their webpages. Once you get to the Learn CSS course, you’ll learn how to develop nice-looking menu bars as well.

Thanks @stevencopeland ! That is very helpful. How do I link the question to the forum of the specific exercise? Is it by using tags like ‘FAQ’?

Oh, you mean you wanted to post your topic on this topic instead?

Or am I misunderstanding…

Yeah. That is what I was trying to figure out.

I’ll transfer these replies on to the end of the that topic.
Is this better?

is it best practice to put img tags in ul tags as done here  https://www.codecademy.com/paths/web-development/tracks/learn-html-web-dev-path/modules/learn-html-tables/lessons/html-tables/exercises/why-tables I cant find an answer on google.

Why is it link href to the css and not a href?

So on this exercise of Introduction to Tables, it is very important that the Cheatsheet is looked at and understood before proceeding further.
I looked at the Cheatsheet and modified the table.
I changed the  elements to  elements from the first column except the first row which the table header.
There was no change in the look of the table.
However, if we want to do certain calculation with the data of the table, then we would not be able to do that with the column that is having string data.
So it is important to use the correct table elements.

The href is linking to the CSS so as to provide the look of the Table. You would learn more about it when you start CSS. Do not worry. For now, I would advise you to understand what the different Table elements do and proceed.

in the first part of the lesson
https://www.codecademy.com/paths/learn-how-to-build-websites/tracks/build-websites-intro/modules/learn-html-tables/lessons/html-tables/exercises/why-tables
How is the header of the table blue in color?
Where was this color defined? Can we change this color from the code that we have?

i see there is a stylesheet linked:
<link href=""style.css"" type=""text/css"" rel=""stylesheet"">

but seems we can’t access the stylesheet. Maybe done so you can focus on html?
So normally, you would be able to change the color, but not in this exercise. I even tried using style attribute, but that didn’t work either.

235,Should non-semantic elements be replaced by semantic wherever possible?,"FAQ,HTML FAQ",semantic-html,7,"
Should non-semantic elements be replaced by non-semantic elements whenever it is possible?
In other words, should non-semantic elements be avoided when there are semantic elements that can be used instead, or does it depends on the case, on the web developer preferences or on anything else?
","



 ajax9536412538:

should non-semantic elements be avoided when there are semantic elements that can be used instead


Yes, that’s correct. Non-semantic HTML elements should be used when there are no semantic elements that can do the job.
Convention specifies it’s preferable to use semantic HTML elements within your code to improve readability, accessibility and SEO.

Thanks again, herebeandre. Another doubt solved 

If semantic elements are the preferred method of html coding, why were the first lessons (several hours of training) so focused on the non-semantic elements?

I imagine three reasons:

Non-semantic HTML elements are used when semantic HTML elements cannot be.
So you have the knowledge that they exist, so that when you’re reading another developer’s code, you’re aware of the function of non-semantic elements.
To my understanding, semantic HTML is a newer concept, so if you’re reading legacy code, you’re aware of the function of non-semantic elements.


yes that makes sense.

I found this video very informative on this subject. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxmB8MlO3m8 The entire video is useful but if you want to skip to the section on “divitus” it is at minute marker 10:36. so about 8 minutes on this topic.  The complete video is about semantics.

hi, in this code example from the “Form a story” project, the formAStorylogo.svg is placed inside of a  section element. Is it better to use the header element instead?

If the svg represents the header of the page, then yes. Always prefer descriptive, semantic elements whenever it makes sense to use them.
Prefer <header> to <section id=""header""> or <div id=""header"">, as well as all the other semantic elements that are available to you.

Why can’t I use  instead of 
in the second lesson of this course we were introduced to the tag  where we put the info displayed in the top of the page, so why donts use it instead of ? do they have different functionalities?

239,What does the value attribute do?,"FAQ,HTML FAQ",forms,9,"
When using the type=“text’” attribute we used the value attribute. But i don’t see it being used when using the type=“number” atrribute. Why so?
","
type has nothing to do with value, of course I mean that type will change how (for example password) and what can be written there (for example number) but there aren’t any links between these like when using for and name.
Value was only needed to set there to provide the “customer” an example that can be written there.
Hope this helps 
(And I’m really sorry for the late reply but I got busy)

they must have  thaught of it as unnecessary, the motive  for them to use  value  attribute was to make sure that we also know  about that""""""""
hope my  answer  helps you correct me if i’m wrong!!!

The purpose of value attribute is just to give an example case of what should be entered over there .

there is atrtribute call “placeholder” that make it better

The best example for me is like placeholder. Thanks.

For the text attribute, we use the value attribute to send textual information when the form is submitted. In the number attribute we do not use the value attribute because the number attribute already defines what kind of data the input element will accept. When the number attribute is rendered, we see an input field has been loaded. In this, numerical information is given by clicking on the up and down arrows present at the right end of this input field, where a click on the up arrow gives us succeeding numbers of a certain number (in default, it is 0) and a click on the down arrow gives us predecessing numbers of it. So there is no need of value attribute here. To clearly understand this, click on the arrows in the number attribute field given in the webpage beside the lesson on Number Input in HTML Forms.
Sorry for the late reply, @breekiki . I joined in this platform much later.
Hope this helps ! 

No, @priyanshumishra58162,  you’re wrong. Check out my post on this question.

It does make sense, thank you. The value attribute was only needed to help people with what they can write in that field. But it won’t be necessary now that they’re required to add a number.

If we examine the specs we will discover that HEAD and BODY are optional elements. This should not be thought to infer they are not needed in conventional documents.  It’s more to accommodate snippets or raw HTML being imported by other documents, or for very simple and straight forward pages.
Ultimately, we should include both HEAD and BODY in regular pages.

245,[FAQ] Tips for the HTML & CSS Final Project,"FAQ,HTML FAQ",,4,"
This is a collection of tips and common issues related to the HTML & CSS Final Project. It will include a mix of coding issues and general tips, such as reducing the file size of photos.
Responsiveness issues:
Many sites I see are missing the meta viewport tag. This tag should be used on all websites as it is required for them to scale correctly on mobile: <meta name=""viewport"" content=""width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"">
You can read about it here if you’re interested: https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_viewport.asp
Or a more detailed explaination: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Mobile/Viewport_meta_tag
I’ve also noticed people often underuse media queries, or don’t use them at all - causing many websites to look really nice on desktop, but have layout issues on mobile. Over half of internet traffic comes from mobile devices, and media queries are important to helping websites look nice, no matter the screen size. If you’re already using media queries, but you want to take responsiveness to the next level, look up an article on mobile-first design - it’s the future.
If you’re not familiar with rem or em I’d recommend learning one of them. rem and em are both equal to the one line height of text, but they are a bit more consistent on different screen resolutions than px (and I find they can also be easier to visualise than trying to imagine pixels). The only difference between em and rem is that rem will be relative to the font size of the html element, whereas em will be relative to the font size of the element it is used on. But both will usually be 16px by default (ie 16px = 1em = 1rem). You can use whichever you prefer, personally I find rem a bit easier.
Code issues:
I’ve noticed quite a lot of websites are missing alt attributes on images. People who are blind or who have vision problems often use a screen reader which can read the alt attribute as a description of the image (you can get a screen reader as a browser plugin if you’re interested in seeing what it’s like). It is also what will show up if your image hasn’t loaded. Alt tags are standard in web development, and not using them can also affect SEO.
There are a couple of exceptions:

If you’re adding background images with CSS you don’t need to use alt attributes
If an image is purely decorative you can use an empty alt tag (alt=“”)

You can also run your code through a validator online which will check for this and other code issues
For HTML: https://validator.w3.org/
For CSS: https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/
Non-code issues:
One thing I notice a lot is people using large image files (often over a megabyte). Considering some statistics say ~50% of users leave a website if it hasn’t loaded in 3 seconds, it’s important not to have unnecessarily large photos. At the same time, clearly pixelated photos don’t look professional, so it’s good to find a balance.
Before uploading your images, check the dimensions of the image. The majority of screens are 1920x1080 or below so there is little benefit to using a photo larger than this. The same goes for smaller photos, an image that takes up half the screen width should generally be 960px (1920 / 2) or less in width, etc. The exact size is up to you, the point is that there’s little benefit benefit to having photos significantly larger than what it will be displayed as, but it will take longer to download.
Another important (and easy) way to reduce image files is to use an image compressor. You can easily upload files and then download a minified version, with minimal loss of quality. I recommend this site: https://compressor.io
If you’re wondering how big images should be, this is a rough guide:
Full screen photos: ideally 200-400kb
Large thumbnail photos (say 1/4 of the screen): ideally 50-100kb
Keep in mind this is a rough guide and only my opinion.
As for file types here is a brief, simplified explanation:
-SVG is great if you have vector drawings
-JPG seems to usually be the best for photos on the web, and is what I use most of the time
-PNG files are usually larger but can have transparent aspects
-GIF generally best avoided if possible, due to low image quality
-ICO is for favicons
A final thing I’ve noticed is people using colors which are hard to read, eg black on black, or white on white - often when text is used over a photo or when the layout changes on mobile. If you’re savvy with Photoshop or similar software there are methods you can use to darken or lighten images and improve contrast, such as putting a filter over the photo to make the text pop against it.
Hope this helps. If you have any further questions, you can post below.

As the image is a link now as per the exercise. should it open now? little confused. Help

At Linking at Will, the exercise asks to add an image element to the index.html, but the link is to a webpage, not an image. When I click solution to try to see how it’s done, nothing would show up.

We have this element coded in the page…
<img src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/courses/web-101/web101-image_brownbear.jpg"" />

That is a picture of a brown bear. We can make it into a link to the Wikipedia article by wrapping that element in an anchor tag…
    <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_bear"" target=""_blank"">
    <img src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/courses/web-101/web101-image_brownbear.jpg"" />
    </a>

See how the image is now in the place of what might normally be link text? An anchor tag will transform any element into a link. I wrote on separate lines but the entire thing can be written on one line, if we prefer.
For now, ignore the target attribute, as that should come up in another lesson. That lets our link open in a new window so we don’t lose our place in the exercise.

Does anyone else have issues remembering what all of the commands mean? I can’t recall what the target=’_blank’ actually means or does.
Could just google it of course… ha.

13 posts were split to a new topic: References to old example

Why is there a back-slash before the end of the img tag?
I thought the img tag was portrayed like this  not 
See example from lesson below.
<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opuntia"" target=""_blank""><img src=""#"" alt=""A red prickly pear fruit""/></a>


We could give you the short answer, but this posted in several topics already, so let’s start with some dry, technical reading…

XHTML


I have done what was asked in for this exercise I believe and inputted this piece of code.
href=""./index.html"" target=_blank>
However the link is not an image but some small icon like a small page. Is this is a fault in my coding or something else?
I’ve removed the opening and closing tags to allow it to be pasted.
Thanks for your time

Yes same thing happened to me. So confused as to why it would tell us to put it in the index but then when u hit solution it has put everything under the media file. not the index. thats where it confused me. Help! can you tell me why it told us to put it in index but then put it in media?!

Hi, is there any way to link text and when you click the text this trigger a click event on a element?
So, let’s say i want to tap to click here and then a click will be triggered to a pardot form …

There are ways, yes; however, that is beyond the scope of these lessons. When you find your way into the JavaScript unit and sufficiently progressed, events will be introduced. Focus upon mastering HTML, and then CSS before taking a segue down this path.

I’m sorry, but I’m not satisfied with this explanation. The instructions for the Linking At Will lesson indicate to alter the index.html link, not the image tag further along in the body. And where did that amazonaws.com link come from? There’s nothing like that in the instructions, just the same wikipedia URL from earlier.
I think I understand the concepts here, it’s just that this puzzle doesn’t make sense to me.
I know I have a long ways to go, so forgive me if the answer is staring me in the face. I’m just getting frustrated.




 rynesanders9:

And where did that amazonaws.com link come from?


Line 40 of the HTML.

I’m a bit confused because it mentions to alter the index not the image of the bear?

Please point that out with a link to the exercise. Thanks.

For anyone still confused about this exercise in 2020… 
When they say to wrap the image in the index.html, they don’t mean the relative path under code line no.9 but the general file name - if you look to the top of your workspace you’ll see the name of the sheet is index.html.
There is only one image we’ve put on our page during the course and it’s under Media. So wrap that one up in anchor tag with the url that is given in exercise as a hyperlink reference (href) and add a blank target attribute. And that’s it.

Hello!
In this exercise, there’s one area of the code I’m confused by. See below:

It seems that the circled part doesn’t belong to the opening nor closing anchor tag, so I’m wondering what purposes this serves.
Thanks!

In the HTML world we are wont to have the most regard for carrots. Erm, carats. They are the principle characters in defining markup. <, >.
Markup defines a region, either textually (has text node) or intrinsically (has attributes). The former has a closing tag, the latter, not.
<a><img></a>

That’s the model for the above screenshot.

247,What happens if we don't add a closing tag?,"FAQ,HTML FAQ",,4,"
Question
In the context of this exercise, what happens if we don’t add a closing tag for an HTML element?
Answer
If you do not add a closing tag for an HTML element, you may end up with unexpected issues with your webpage. However, excluding a closing tag will not cause error messages or crashes, so they technically are not an absolute requirement. But, this does not mean you should exclude them.
One important reason to add a closing tag is that anything that follows an opening tag in the HTML code will become nested in that element. For example, say you meant to have two separate elements, such as a <div> and a <p> element. Like so,
<body>
  <div>
  </div>
  <p>
  </p>
</body>

If you omit the closing tags of the elements, like so
<body>
  <div>
  <p>
</body>

then the paragraph element is now nested inside the div element. This can cause many issues in terms of layout and design of a webpage.
Adding closing tags is also best practice, and should always be included. If you do that then errors will be avoided, and it will reduce confusion when other developers are working on the same code.
Some elements do not need a closing tag (known as “void” tags), such as <br>, <img>, and <link> tags, because they do not have content. But for other types of elements, you should always add a closing tag to them.
","
I thought that a error message would pop up, but I’m new, and I was wrong.
@mtf Explains it below.




 tonescript:

An error message will be on your screen, and the line of code will not work.


HTML does not provide error messages. The browser will make an attempt to render the markup, and if it fails to, it just continues on to the next item in normal flow.



 jephos249:

(known as “void” tags)


void elements, which are self-closing tags, to keep things semantic.

Ah. Thank you for telling me. I only joined recently.

@mtf Thanks.

why isn’t
<p>
        Whitespace and indentation make html documents easier to ready
      </p>

all on one line?

I think a better question why use Whitespace instead of one or two <br>s?  The latter is so much shorter and easier to type out.

Whitespace is spaces found in code but will not be shown in the result.
For example:
<p> Paragraph One </p>



<p> Paragraph Two </p>

The above code ^ I have many lines of whitespace between the two paragraph tags, but when the browser loads the code that whitespace won’t show. The only space between the two paragraphs will be the default space as if there wasn’t three lines of whitespace between them.
The <br> tag effects how the code load. If I were to put it between the two paragraphs then there would be an empty space between the paragraphs when the page it loaded.
Hope this clears up.
So Whitespace doesn’t effect how HTML renders

is there a transcription for this video? I see there is no subtitles option on the video.

No transcription exists to my knowledge, but since I had some time I took it upon myself to provide one…

Let’s talk about browsers and servers. This video will teach you about their purpose and how they contribute to the giant network that we know as the internet.
What happens when you request a website in your browser?
Well, every time you type a web address and press Enter a series of things happen in the few seconds it takes for the website to appear on your screen.
Over recent decades there have been many web browsers. Some of the most popular today are, Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Internet Explorer and Opera.
All of these browsers serve the same basic purpose to display websites for you to read and interact with. But just how do they do this?
First the browser takes the web address you provided and sends the request to a server across internet for the files that make up the web site.
The contacted server is dedicated to holding the website’s files. It may even be thousands of miles away from you and your device. Once the server receives the request it contains logic for processing the request and identifying the files and data that the client has specified. It responds to the browser’s request with the necessary files.
This is the process that allows the browser to display website files to you, and it happens in the few seconds it takes for websites to load on your device screen.
You may be asking yourself, “What is a server?”
A server is a specialized computer connected to a network. The role of this computer is to listen for requests from network devices and send back data. Servers provide or serve up resources like website files, data and assets like images or video, along with other cool things. Servers are not like the computers you may be used to. They are focused on data storage and retrieval so they have no monitors or keyboards. A server will need lots of computing power to serve up websites that reach thousands or even millions of users.
Next we need to understand how the browsers and servers understand each other. The internet follows protocols or rules that govern the format of data sent over the internet or other networks. Browsers and servers communicate with one another using the internet protocol known as HTTP. You’ve seen this before. HTTP, or HyperText Transfer Protocol allows for data transfer. When you see the S at the end of HTTP the data is being transfered securely.
An important part of the HyperText Transfer Protocol is that each request has a request method that specifies the type of request being made. For example, if the user is just asking to fetch a resource this is specified as a GET request. If a user is sending data to the server for example, such as submitting information via a form, this is specified as a POST request.
When the server sends back a response it sends a status code that accompanies the requested resource. You might be familiar with seeing 404 error messages when browsing the internet. This is an HTTP response code that indicates that the requested content wasn’t found. HTTP provides reliable structure to the interplay between the client and the server.
Let’s review what we learned today. There are three important things to remember:


The browser sends requests to the server and displays or renders website files.


The server stores website files and sends them to the web browser upon request.


HTTP, or HyperText Transfer Protocol is a standardized set of rules for how browsers and servers transfer data to one another.

253,Should Adam's Greenworks get a scope?,"FAQ,HTML FAQ","tables,q-a",26,"
Why didn’t we put 'Adam’s Greenwork under scope=col attribute?
","
Do you mean like this?
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th scope=""col"">Company Name</th>
        <th scope=""col"">Number of Items to Ship</th>
        <th scope=""col"">Next Action</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>


yes, but just Adam’s Greenwork

We wouldn’t be assigning scope to a data cell. That is meant for THs, as shown above.

This really helped        

Is this how we should have done it? I’ve done as following and it still worked.
<table> 
 <tr>
   <th>Company Name</th>
   <th>Number of Items to Ship</th>
   <th>Next Action</th>
 </tr>


Looks okay, but does it comply with the instructions? Don’t forget to close the TABLE. We see you have not declared a THEAD, or scope on the THs. Is that still to come in the instructions?

Hi, I have tried to assign scope   “row” or “col” for the  but it didnt make any different as below:

<th scope=""row"">Company Name</th>

<th scope=""row"">Number of Items to Ship</th>

<th scope=""row"">Next Action</th>



The THs are column headers so the scope should be col, not row

Thanks a lot mtf for the above answer but why row or col usage didn’t make any different in web page I’m developing

The scope attribute is used by screen readers to enhance accessibility for visually impaired users.
So you won’t see any difference on your page, but a vision impaired person using a screen reader will benefit from proper usage of scope attribute.
So for table headings “scope” is set to “col”, and for “Adam’s Greenwork” it should be set to “row”

I’m sorry, I’m still confused about this particular subject. So I did Adam’s Greenworks and I’m struggling to fully understand the purpose of putting/not putting scope=“col” or scope=“row”. If scope attribute is for the visually impaired, what makes this correct/incorrect?

I’m confused,
wouldn’t the first three Headings: Company Name, Number of Items and Next Action be scope=“col”
and then Adam’s Greenworks shouldn’t be scoped as is not a table measuring two variables but just data.





Ok, I just looked it up and I think you are mixing rows ups with columns. The codecademy lesson is correct. Rows are arranged horizontally, according to differencebetween.net
Not sure about the following question, as I am very new at coding
Difference Between Rows and Columns

Is it really necessary to add a scope=column?
I remember reading something about multiple cells in a tr are automatically shown as columns next to each other.

Yes,as Far I know scope=“Column” must be added to the table heading(th) in the given practice section to indicate that this particular column represent this type of information.
But it works even without that scope attribute, because scope attribute is actually for screen readers,it do not make any visual changes to it.




 mtf:

We see you have not declared a THEAD, or scope on the THs.


Hi mtf, could you please elaborate on this? Why do we need to declare THEAD? What is the role of THEAD? AND what’s the relationship between THEAD and SCOPE?

THEAD describes the table. SCOPE defines the applicable range, whether it is a column below the TH attribute, or a row beside the TH attribute.
Scope helps the user agent to connect a heading to its associated TD elements. It makes no difference to a non-assisted user.




 mtf:

SCOPE defines the applicable range


Does this range including the heading(TH) and its associated TD elements? OR only the associated table data elements?
BTW, is the cell in Table HTML as same as the “box in Excel”? Does the cell include TD, TH, THEAD, etc?

The TD is a table data cell, so much like a spreadsheet. TH are headings that may appear above, or to the left of the table data. While THEAD is a container, I wouldn’t consider it a cell. The cells would be TDs in the TR that is enclosed, which may or may not be column headings. The TD could colspan over the entire table and look like a table heading, or a prose description of what the table is about.

This question isn’t about the purpose of the exercise.  The “defer” tag works fine.  The rest of the exercise confuses me.  I assume there’s a bug somewhere but I can’t figure out where it is.
In the instructions for this exercise it states

Each script tag re-styles the Codecademy logo, but the  turnYellow.js  executes last, making the font color  'yellow'

I’m wondering why the script isn’t working (i.e. the font color doesn’t turn yellow).  I clicked run, and the code (I didn’t write the code - it was pre-coded) looks like it should work:
var elem = document.getElementById('logo');
   	  elem.style.color = ""yellow"";

It seems to linked properly in the html file:
<head>
    <link rel=""stylesheet"" href=""style.css"">
    <script id=""blue"" src=""turnBlue.js"" ></script>
   <script id=""yellow"" src=""turnYellow.js""></script>
  </head>

Anyone know why it doesn’t work?

According to the Chrome Dev Console, the default color is pink, not yellow. Maybe a mistake?

Same bug over here. Would also like to know why it doesn’t turn yellow on a run without the defer tag.
When looking in the console I get the following errors:
api.segment.io/v1/p:1 Failed to load resource: net::ERR_BLOCKED_BY_CLIENT
js-agent.newrelic.com/nr-spa-1118.min.js:1 Failed to load resource: net::ERR_BLOCKED_BY_CLIENT

turnBlue.js:2 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'style' of null
    at turnBlue.js:2
turnYellow.js:2 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'style' of null
    at turnYellow.js:2


Hello, i have the same problem here, run the exercice doesnt make yellow or blue. Use defer make it run on both element ( blue or yellow) but why this doesn’t work simply and need to use defer for make one of script work ?

I think it’s because this is happening, in this order:

the stylesheet is loaded

turnblue.js is loaded

turnyellow.js is loaded
the html, including the <p> tag is loaded

When we run the code, I don’t think steps 2 and 3 apply anything, because the DOM and thus the <p> tag are not yet loaded.
So, at step 4, the <p> tag is loaded by the browser’s parser and is thus given the styling from the stylesheet loaded in step 1.
Thus we can apply defer to either or both .js files, and the <p> tag will take on the new colour as expected.

Correct me if what I write below is wrong.
I think there is one important thing about the defer attribute missing from the Learn section of this lesson. The defer attribute allows the HTML parser to continue parsing the elements below the <script> at the same time as loading the JavaScript file referred to by the src attribute of <script>.
Otherwise, there is no point of using the defer attribute instead of placing the <script> elements at the end of the HTML file.
This point is not clear at all from the Learn section of this lesson. This FAQ, linked from the lesson, hints at it by saying

“Using  defer  like this is potentially faster than using the  <script>  at the end of the body, as it loads the  <script>  asyncronosly”

This point then suddenly shows up in the next lesson on the async attribute by saying,

“similar to the  defer  attribute, the HTML parser will continue parsing the rest of the HTML as the script is downloaded in the background”.

This is quite confusing a way of explaining the defer attribute…

          link rel=""stylesheet"" href=""style.css"">
  	
script id=""blue"" src=""turBlue.js""></script>
script id=""yellow"" src=""turnYellow.js""></script>

  
  		
  	class=""centered"" id=""logo"">Codecademy
Hey in the above code as i used  element back to back without using defer element the logo first should turn blue and then yellow but the color is not changing it’s showing only black
Can anyone tell me why is it happening?

257,What does `<div>` mean?,"FAQ,HTML FAQ","elements-structure,q-a",2,"
What does <div> mean?
","
Marking up a document involves wrapping text with tags. The above is a DIVision tag for sectioning the page. In the pre-HTML5 days, we used <div></div> with special id attributes to section a page into HEADER, CONTENT, FOOTER, but we now have special elements for that purpose.
<div id=""header"">

</div>
<div id=""content"">

</div>
<div id=""footer"">

</div>

Sectioning helps us to organize our document by grouping related elements in a container for easy identification. Markinp up a document is akin to writing an outline of the content.

258,How to use special characters or accented letters in regex?,"FAQ,HTML FAQ","forms,q-a",12,"
Can you tell me the pattern for both “escape” and “@,!”
Thanks
","
In a regex, ‘special characters’ are those that symbolize a particular class, such as \s for whitespace characters, \w for word characters, or \? for an actual question mark, \* for an actual asterix, since ? and * (among others) are also special characters.
The @ character can be used directly in the pattern without escapement. It is not special at all since it has no meaning apart from being a printable character.
The lesson should have link in the narrative to a table of regex special characters and their meanings.

In this exercise , why do we have to add the “+” sign to “[a-zA-Z0-9]”   ?

I want to know the answer too1

The + special character is known as a quantifier.

Hi there,
In Sweden we have 3 more letters after Z: Å, Ä + Ö
How do I manage that writing code? 

I was wondering the other day about str.isalpha() which if memory serves was a question regarding Chinese characters being recognized. Perhaps the same applies to Swedish?
@ionatan will be better informed than me as I believe he is from Sweden, as well. In Python 3 the default string object is unicode so one can well imagine string methods will work on all characters alphabetic (letter) in nature. Something to look into.

Unicode HOWTO


Thanks for providing this information but I couldn’t associate the examples with their sample matches. If you could explain me this it’ll be very helpful.




 tag9382624324:

associate the examples with their sample matches



Version A-b1_1
The specified pattern expects the word, ‘Version’ at the beginning, and a dash (-) between two word character groups. Note that were we to use the * quantifier the dash wouldn’t be mandatory (neither would be Version). The word character group is made up of, [0-9][A-Za-z][_] if I’m not mistaken. The dash above had to be manually written into the pattern.
ABC
The pattern expects non-digit characters where there are exactly three characters in the sample.
156
The pattern expects 2 to 4 digit characters in the sample.
regex_tutorial
The pattern expects at minimum, 3 characters which must all be word characters.
AAACC
The pattern expects the three characters ‘ABC’ in that order where B is optional.
plural
The pattern expects an ‘s’ character which does not repeat, but may be absent.

That’s a kind of off the cuff rundown. Be sure to read up on Regex patterns if this is something that interests you. It can take years to master the engine so the more exposure you give yourself, the more it becomes second nature. I’m not there, to be sure. One still uses basic patterns in .replace(), test(), .match() when there is a measure of confidence.
Be sure to include JS’s RegExp() special object in your reading, study and practice.

Although I’m not an expert and can’t answer the questions, I found this very useful website for playing around with regular expressions, and I thought I would share the link! It’s for Javascript, but as discussed in this thread, it seems like HTML and Javascript use the same rules for regex.




 themomgineer:

it seems like HTML and Javascript use the same rules for regex.


In fact, all languages use the same rules since Regular Expressions don’t belong to any one particular language (though it does trace back to Perl). It is a language unto itself. Each programming language has a built in Regex Engine so they can all handle patterns in the same way, though they may have their own particular syntax for expressing the pattern.

Thank you, mtf, for that clarification and background information!

259,Can `<i>` be used instead of `<em>`?,"FAQ,HTML FAQ",elements-structure,4,"
can <i> be used instead of <em>? if so, always or only on specific situations?
","
Hi, there!
The short answer is that it’s a matter of semantics. <i> is mostly for presentation. For example, if you had a book title, you might use <i> tag to make the title in italics. <em> will be interpreted as actual emphasis. For example, if you wish to say “That is your bag.” (with the emphasis on “your”, obviously) you would use <em>. It matters because a screen-reading program such as might be used by a vision-impaired person will not read anything inside an <i> tag with any emphasis, since <i> is merely for visual appearance.

260,Why does my website work without the <!DOCTYPE html> tag?,"FAQ,HTML FAQ",q-a,2,"
Question
Why does my website work without the <!DOCTYPE html> tag?
Answer
The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration is a mandatory instruction for the browser; it tells the browser which version of HTML the HTML document is written in, currently HTML5. Without the declaration, some browsers will render HTML5 content correctly, however, other browsers may render the HTML document in a previous version of HTML, and may cause other unexpected behavior (like affecting the CSS, scripts, etc).
","
The DOCTYPE presence is an instruction for the browser as to how it will render your HTML and CSS. Without it you fall into quirk mode instead of standard mode. Quirk mode will cause the browser to mimic rendering for older browsers rather than following new standards (formatting, cell sizing etc.) of a newer website. This means your new website may not render the same way but it will still render. It will just render in a way an older browser may have rendered rather than with all the new standards.

261,Do I need to repeat `<li>` every time? Is there a way to use a loop?,"FAQ,HTML FAQ","elements-structure,q-a",6,"
Is there any way to not repeat yourself when representing several list elements? Or is it standard practice to have several <li> tags among <ul> or <ol> tags even if we represent, for example, a dozen elements?
","
I like this question, i think this is a good question. But there is no simple answer.
Lets look at a simple example:
https://jsbin.com/fojitexiya/edit?html,css,output
i made a simple top navigation menu. Could we eliminate the duplicate <li></li> elements? Yes, we could using a loop:
https://jsbin.com/hakifucome/edit?html,css,js,output
Don’t know if you learned JS yet, but as you can see, now we have a lot more code. Yes, we don’t have any “duplicate code”, but the abstraction needed this can hardly be justified.
Sure, there are cases where loop are justified, look at this page:
https://discuss.codecademy.com/latest
its part of the codecademy forum, you can say with almost absolute certainty that a loop of some kind is used to render each topic in this list overview. So there certainly are plenty of cases where a loop is fully justified.
I hope this shows why there isn’t one definitive answer 

I don’t know much about JS, but I think I understand that you created a loop in a JS file ‘attached’ to the html file in https://jsbin.com/hakifucome/edit?html,css,js,output .
I guess that, inside this loop, if you wanted to add more elements to the list, you would only need to add them following "" ‘contact’ "" in the first line of JS code:
Old:

const navItems = [‘home’, ‘about’, ‘contact’]

New:

const navItems = [‘home’, ‘about’, ‘contact’, ‘forum’]

I hope I got it right. Thank you for your time, stetim94. I really appreciate it. 




 ajax9536412538:

I guess that, inside this loop, if you wanted to add more elements to the list, you would only need to add them following "" ‘contact’ "" in the first line of JS code:


exactly. But that is the other side of the story. If you wanted a page where users could add or remove elements from the list, we could use JS to do this. So then the additional complexity/abstraction is justified.
There are always multiple factors (flexibility, maintainability, cost, efficiency) to consider

262,What happens if I directly add the `<li>` without adding the `<ul>`?,"FAQ,HTML FAQ",,6,"
What happens if I directly add the li  without adding the ul
","
I noticed that creating a list using “li” tags but without the “ul” tag still results in a listed format. But I also found that adding the “ul” tag results in the list becoming indented, while removing it causes the list to appear flush left.  So is the function of the “ul” tag more a visual organizer, like “div”, or a formatting tool? Or both? (If someone could also explain how to format a comment so the tags appear properly, I would appreciate it! Can’t seem to figure that out).

The main purpose in using the designated containers is for validity and structure. LI is essentially a DIV with the same ability to contain other block level elements, including tables. We do not expect to see the element outside of a specified container. They have an intended use, with organization being a possible consideration, but not formatting.
HTML is not a presentational language. It is a structural, declarative language aimed at giving meaning to textual content and other media  We never choose an element for how it will appear, visually, but for where it appears in the document outline.
```html

```



 avdextergaming071237:

What happens if I directly add the li without adding the ul


Browsers are very good these days at filling in missing bits in order to parse something that can be rendered. When <li> appears in the wild with no <ul>, <ol> or <menu> container, the browser may well fall back to a UL. However, it does not have licence to apply default UL, OL, or MENU styles. Given only an LI, those are the only default styles that can be applied.

Very helpful, thank you!

Brand new to html here. Question on lists:
if you don’t want a bullet, can you make a list and just have your list with > br < breaks rather than > li < ?? or does  not using > li < take out extra formatting that might be helpful later?
** i used opposite brackets so the commands don’t actually happen in this post! how do you guys show the commands without it actually happening?

<br> is not for creating lists any more than <p> is. Lists are contiguous blocks of related data, as indicated by the markup structure.
If you do not want bullets, then set the padding to zero.
ul {
    padding: 0
}

If that doesn’t work, then try,
ul {
    list-style-type: none;
}

Suggest experiment with margin and padding on the UL to witness the various effects.

264,What are self-closing tags?,"FAQ,HTML FAQ","elements-structure,q-a",6,"
It was said that both will render correctly, but is it standard practice amongst developers to include or omit the final slash when using self-closing tags?
","
There is no best practice rule owing to the base case usage, serving up text. When that is the case, which for our purposes is always the case, the HTML 4 rules apply. No slash.
<img src=""pic.png"">

Where it gets important is when the document markup must not only validate, but must conform to XML specs. That makes the document not a text document, but an XML application. XML concerns itself not with presentation, but with data. Production sites like CC use XML compliant pages under the XHTML doctype. These are complex pages that are sewn together with dozens of pieces of data. We’re not going to be doing that any time soon.
Bottom line, if the exercise doesn’t expect it, don’t write it. That applies to all void elements. HTML 4 rules apply, and are valid HTML5.

Okay cool. Thanks for your reply!

Just to be clear, self-closing tags is an XHTML term. In HTML 4 the term didn’t exist yet. Even way back then,
<p>some text
<p>some text
<p>some text

would render as three paragraph elements with one line height space between them. Same applies to HTML5. The browser will insert the ENDTAG if it is missing. Do we call these self-closing tags? Well, no, we don’t. They are lazy coder; browser closed tags.
For IMG and INPUT and LINK and META we never had to close them or think about it because they do not have a textContent or innerHTML node. They are meta objects that have attributes and values.
Where the whole self-closing lingo came from was the need for XHTML to conform with XML demands, namely, no tag left unclosed. The cure was a slash at the end and the term, ‘self-closing’ was born. XML was satisfied. IE5.x for the Mac was not being fooled by that hack, and in the din of it all, somebody discovered that a space before the slash would make it work. Problem solved; hack adapted.
One needs to go back two decades to find this discussion, and barring any blatant inaccuracies can be taken at face value. That’s where the space came from. The slash was always the way to appease XML and not have to degrade HTML any more than necessary.

As you can see in the two pics uploaded below, the ""[br] tags work just fine, however after running and moving to the next topic I noticed that they were converted to “[/br]” tags. Could anyone please help me with why this is happening, will it also happen when I do this to my notepad file?

These tags are all valid in HTML5:
<br>
<br/>
<br />

The last one is XHTML, with mandatory syntax, B, R, space, slash.
The middle one is HTML5, mandatory only when serving as XML compliant markup.
The first one is the legacy syntax of HTML 4, and all that is needed when serving HMTL as text/html which for most of us is the case.
There may be some merit in learning to use the second form in all our work just to form the habit on the chance that one may learn React.js and JSX rendering markup, which requires that form. This is for down the road. For our purposes it doesn’t matter if we only use <br>.

265,What is a URL?,"FAQ,HTML FAQ",q-a,2,"
Question
What is a URL?
Answer
URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator, which is the address of a unique resource on the web and can be an HTML page, image, stylesheet, etc.
URLs can be absolute (full) URLs or relative URLs.  An absolute URL contains the domain name of the resource, like www.codecademy.com and the path to the exact file, like /learn. Altogether an absolute URL would look like this: www.codecademy.com/learn.  A relative URL is a URL that is called from inside the current document and requires the exact path to the file but not the domain name.  For example, a URL that links to an about.html page inside the same project folder as an index.html page would look like this: about.html.
","
A  Uniform Resource Locator  ( URL ), colloquially termed a  web address  is a reference to a [web resource] that specifies its location on a [computer network] and a mechanism for retrieving it. A URL is a specific type of [Uniform Resource Identifier]  although many people use the two terms interchangeably   URLs occur most commonly to reference web pages , but are also used for file transfer ([ftp], email ([mailto] and database access ([JDBC] and many other applications.
Also to add to what my sister just said , URL has five main parts. They are:
the scheme, subdomain, top-level domain, second-level domain, and subdirectory.
If you need more clarification, don’t bother to ask . Thanks
"
266,Could I use a src attribute on a <p> tag to load in raw text?,"FAQ,HTML FAQ",q-a,3,"
Question
Could I use a src attribute on a p tag to load in raw text?
Answer
No. Unlike some other global attributes which you will learn about in lesson 2, the src attribute can only be applied to specific tags of which the p tag is not included. In other words, not all attributes are available to every tag. To find out which attributes are available to every tag, take a look at this list of global attributes.
","
What is the difference between src and href? they seem to have a similar function

A src attribute points to a resource that will be downloaded and inserted into the page at the given position (normal flow by default). Elements that have a src attribute include,
img
video
audio
source
script

The href attribute is an hypertext reference to a resource situated on the web, such as a web page or a style sheet. Elements  that have an href attribute include,
a
link
blockquote
cite
q

Correction
blockquote uses the cite attribute
cite does not have an href attribute.
q uses the cite attribute.

267,Can we use an alt attribute with the <video> tag?,"FAQ,HTML FAQ",q-a,2,"
Question
The text content of <video> tags seems to behave in the same way as the alternative text for the <img> tag. For consistency, can we use an alt attribute with the <video> tag instead?
Answer
This is a great observation! We can not use the <alt> attribute within the opening <video> tag. While this may seem inconsistent, this is actually by design as we might want our video element to contain some fallback options. For example, if the video doesn’t load we might want to display a link to another video that does. As attributes cannot contain markup, this scenario would not be possible with alt attributes alone.
If this fallback handling gives the developer more control, you might be wondering why the <img> tag doesn’t follow suit. The answer to this involves backwards-compatibility troubles.
","
if the alt attribute cant be added to  tag, in the video not supported area, can you add the alt link to the video?

268,Can I also use a <title> tag in place of heading elements?,"FAQ,HTML FAQ",q-a,2,"
Question
If headings are suppose to be used for titles, why does this exercise use the <title> tag for the “Brown Bears” label near the top of the document? Can I also use a title tag in place of heading elements?
Answer
The <title> tag can only be used within the head element and (unlike the h1-h6 elements) is never used to create a heading hierarchy within the <body> of an HTML document. As you will learn in lesson 2,  the content of the <title> tag will display within a window tab but not within the page itself.
","
No, title is only used for the head tag of the website.

How could we specify a different HTML version than HTML5?

The simple answer is to specify a different doctype.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_type_declaration


Dear respected sir/madam ,why we use this sign ( ! ) before writing DOCTYPE , what this symbol means?

Owing that there are several document types, of which HTML is but one, the DTD, or Document Type Declaration is of necessity written in another language. SGML is the language that DTDs are written in.
The role played by SGML in the early days may well have been supplanted by XML in modern times. Either way, it’s another language helping the client to adapt to the current document with which it is interacting. On top of that we have C++ (C# in IE and Edge, Go in Chrome) helping ES manage the behavior of the interface as well as manage the style sheets and other browser features.
All the behind the scenes stuff is of no concern to us on the development side. It’s what we call tools. We didn’t make the hammer or wrench, only use them.

Shouldn’t adresses on  to files on a same folder have the “.” before the “/”? Why that doesn’t happen on this exercise?

What exactly is form used for, why do we need it? I don’t understand why I need to use.

The use of the action attribute in form tag is to know at which document the data needs to be sent but the data need through the form needs to be sent to the server than why do we send data to the document?

    Brown bear  ............this links to index.html right? but it is already inside this index.html no/
        ","
Yeah, it links to the Brown Bear page. It’s so that you can come back to it after visiting About Me.

why did we first add a link to index.html ? isnt it the file we are working on it?

The purpose behind a link to the current page is that it is the “homepage” and we are creating a consistent series of links across all the pages of our website. Each page will contain this same set of links even though it includes a link to the current page, it can help users understand where they are at within the website. Think of it as a sitemap.

HTML tags are not functional, but semantic. Their meaning can be found in the tagname. NAV says what its children represent, navigation links. It is a sectioning element for flow content; i.e., links.
Something to keep close by when learning HTML is the chapter on elements.

What is the difference between ARIA-Role and ARIA-Label? I understood, that both will be read out in a screen reader.

Hi Minhdoan, with Aria-Role you choose between a defined set of options. The accessible browser reads the option and behaves accordingly.
Aria-Label is a free text description that you use when you want something to be read out aloud to someone who hears only the audio of the website…

2 posts were split to a new topic: What does “document type” mean?

4 posts were split to a new topic: Why is “DOCTYPE” uppercase but “html” lower?

Can <!DOCTYPE html> be <!DOCTYPE html /> or is that a no-no?

Look up the doctype for XHTML and go by that. If it doesn’t have a self closing tag, then it would qualify as a ‘no-no’.
It’s fair to assume that XML syntax would not come into play until the doctype is declared, so the reasonable assumption would be that no space, and/or slash would be recognized by the user agent.

In the lecture it says

In the future, however, a new standard will override HTML5. To make sure your document is forever interpreted correctly, always include  <!DOCTYPE html>  at the very beginning of your HTML documents.

So why don’t I write <!DOCTYPE html5 or something like that? Won’t future things, like HTML6 use “html” as well?

HTML is a living language which will continue to evolve into newer iterations. The latest recommendations will always be the de facto for newer browser versions. That means we never have to change the doctype again. It will always be,
<!DOCTYPE html>

or whichever variation of that your style guide recommends.

Thanks for the fast response.
My train of thought was something like: What if  in future iterations of html no longer means line breaks. Then my code would no longer work. But I guess people wouldn’t just change currently already used syntax, but rather invent new ones.




 moritzklbel615965015:

But I guess people wouldn’t just change currently already used syntax


That has always been the case. It’s known as backward compatibility.
There are some exceptions, such that elements and attributes can eventually become deprecated or obsolete, preventing the document from being validated. It won’t have a detrimental effect, though, as the browser will simply ignore it. HTML is rendered as best it can be by any browser.

Is there a fast way to make the closing tag flush with the opening tag?
Right now it looks like this:
<tr>
  </tr>

Then I backspace twice to align the tags.
Is there a way to use the Enter key to not auto add another indent?
","
Did you try entering it as a single line? In some editors, typing,
<tr></tr>

if entered that way will self adjust to,
<tr>

</tr>

If not, then welcome to Notepad for Windows.  JK
I find it not difficult to believe that there is a limit on the intuitive nature of even the best editors, but the above is one possible way to be in step with the intuitiveness of one’s editor. Enter the element with OPENTAG and ENDTAG and let the editor sort it out.
Usually we just need to place the cursor at the end of the OPENTAG and hit Enter and the editor will supply the indent for the nested line. When we reach then end of our inputs we press Delete instead of Enter and place the cursor at the end of the ENDTAG and hit Enter to get the same indentation for the next line.
Whatever intuition is missing from an editor, I don’t mind manually setting my nesting indents, whether during composition or after. It will never have an effect on the rendering process and is just an aid to self-documentation, by way of relating structure and inheritence.

Another trick might be to include a starting nested element,
<tr><td></td></tr>

Enter that, then place the cursor just after the first opentag and hit Enter. Now place the cursor just before the last endtag and hit Enter. The editor should again sort it out that indentation is cancelled on the next line. Place the cursor after the last endtag and hit Enter and it should line up with that endtag.
<!--cursor-->
<tr>|<td></td></tr>    <!-- Enter -->

<tr>
  <td></td>|</tr>      <!-- Enter -->

Thanks

I am using Codeacademy to learn HTML. When in the module my font for my Codeacademy was reduced to the point that I cannot see the HTML.  How can I increase the font in Codeacademy screens so I can read the code?

As far as I know, the LE is scalable so you can zoom the text size. If you find all the lessons to be similar, then in your browser you can set a default font size that is larger, to suit.

I am a beginer to this course and  have few doubts
1.even if we are not using the element  text is being printed so why should we use this element
2.Also while using attributes like itemprop,itemscope  etc i dont find any visible difference so what are the applications of such attributes
Thank you

Hi! I’m intrigued as to how the number of websites can go down so much in 2013 and 2015. How is this data sourced?

The number of registered domains is a known quantity that can be sourced from the DNS system and from search engine indices, independently. The system would know exactly how many domains are propagated across it. Search engines would have crawl data that could not only tell them how many sites there are, but how many pages there are, to within a small margin or error.

I asked on Quora as well, I am curious too:
The link to the question is here

What happened in 2010 that caused a decrease in total web pages?

Welcome, @theewhitesnake,
Off the cuff, not looking at the data, one could attribute it to rapid growth of dynamic web and a notable decrease in static web pages (which may be due to being removed from the index as abandoned). Just a thought.

283,Why don't we need the action and method attributes anymore?,"FAQ,HTML FAQ",forms,2,"
Why is it that from exercise 5 onwards the form-tag in the explanation screen on the left no longer has the attributes action=""/example.html"" and method=“POST”>?
","
I must be very late to answer, but I think it might still help.
I think they have not included the mentioned attributes because they just wanted to tell us the meaning and use of those attributes in the beginning. Since in these programs, we are not actually sending any values, but we are just learning how to use the different elements in forms, those attributes are actually not needed.
Hope this helps,
Thanks.

284,What other things can HTML links be set to?,"FAQ,HTML FAQ",q-a,1,"
Question
In the context of this exercise, what other things can HTML links be set to?
Answer
Links in HTML can be set to several different things.
As covered in the exercise, links are mainly used to connect a webpage with other webpages. This can be done by setting the link to go to the URL of a specified site, like
<a href=""www.codecademy.com"">Codecademy</a>
Links can also be set to link to documents and files, such as text, audio, video and image files. For example,
<a href=""www.example.com/image.svg"">Image</a>
HTML links can also be set to a specific part of the same webpage, such as a section header. This can be done using the id attribute of an element, and using that id value preceded by a # as the value of the href attribute. For example, in the following code, clicking the “Main” text would make the browser jump to the section with the corresponding id value of ""main"".
<a href=""#main"">Main</a>

<div id=""main"">
</div>

285,What if I want to limit the number of check boxes that can be selected?,"FAQ,HTML FAQ","forms,q-a",8,"
If needed how would I limit the amount of check boxes that can be selected? In this exercise I could select all three of them, but lets think that you’re limited to only 1 topping.
Thanks!
","
Checkboxes intentionally allow multiple selections. Radio buttons, on the other hand will only permit one item to be selected.

Checkboxes vs. Radio Buttons


Thanks! And is there an in-between? Not only one option but not all of them neither?

Since checkboxes are essentially independent and do not represent selection from a group the way radio buttons do, we would need to implement our own control over the maximum allowable selections. Bear in mind that it goes against the grain of checkboxes, since it would forbid the completely normal, Select All checkbox.
That is not to say, “don’t do it,” just that it is atypical to impose limits on a checkbox list.
One particular use would be a selection from a list by keyword or label, then toggling it so all others may be selected (for removal, or whatever). Gmail would be an example of potential usage for such a feature.
To my best recollection, HTML does not give us a mechanism to limit checkboxes. If my memory is bad, so be it. There is still a way to do it with the DOM, though, once we give it some thought.
The first consideration is the POSTDATA object that is created when we Submit a form. But that would be something easier to analyze server-side.
The second consideration would be to inspect the form values onsubmit, as it were, though this could get messy with sending the form up to the server.
The third consideration would be to post a listener on that section of the form and keep track of the number of checkboxes checked, then disable that section of the form when the maximum is reached. This would not interfere with the submit event.

mtf, you are an absolute gem. I appreciate how thorough you are with all of your explanations on all the FAQs, it is beyond helpful!

Makes complete sense! As I went through radio buttons I understood what you meant by selecting from a group (and I think this could also be a suitable solution when the time comes, right?).
Anyway, thanks again!

Once you get into scripting, take another look at this challenge. Say we have six choices and wish the user to select any three. As forms go, design is everything. Usability is one of the reasons some people simply won’t use them.

Amen to that, Stevie.

In a form , while using multiple input tags having the same name attribute of type “checkbox”

By information , I mean multiple values from the selected checkboxes (input tags).

 data8636296807:

how the information is stored and transferred from the form to the action attribute?


The action attribute contains the URL of the form handler, typically a server-side script that parses the query string attached to the request. On the client side, form values are transformed into that query string on Submit. This is done internally by the browser.

288,What is the difference between `id` and `name`?,"FAQ,HTML FAQ","forms,q-a",6,"
The understanding of all the elements of the course is going amazingly well, but one thing won’t connect in my brain: the difference between id and name? Is there a very clear explanation for this difference and wht use them both in one ?
","
id is mostly used in javascript or for binding labels to stuff. For example:
<input type=""text"" id=""foo""/>
<label for=""foo"">bar</label>

or a javascript example:
document.getElementById(""foo"");

The name attribute i have only seen used for the radio type for options.
in this case the name makes sure the radio buttons are grouped to each other. for example:
<div>
  <input type=""radio"" id=""huey"" name=""drone"" value=""huey""
         checked>
  <label for=""huey"">Huey</label>
</div>

<div>
  <input type=""radio"" id=""dewey"" name=""drone"" value=""dewey"">
  <label for=""dewey"">Dewey</label>
</div>

<div>
  <input type=""radio"" id=""louie"" name=""drone"" value=""louie"">
  <label for=""louie"">Louie</label>
</div>

As can be seen all options are grouped under the name “drone” which makes sure only one radio button can be selected.
Not sure if name is used in any other way by default. But since name is just an attribute you could also use it with javascript. It would act similar to a class attribute i believe.

Thanks. Name for grouping in something like radio buttons makes sense. I’ll let it go through my brain  I will remember your help when I’m months in this Web Devloper career path and need to use it!

If I’ve this piece of code I’m currently working on as part of the course. Why do I always have id and name?
 <form action=""story.html"" method=""get"">
        <label for=""animal-1"">Animal:</label>
        <input id=""animal-1"" type=""text"" name=""animal-1"" required>
        <br>
        <label for=""animal-2"">Another Animal:</label>
        <input id=""animal-2"" name=""animal-2"" type=""text"" required>
        <br>
        <label for=""animal-3"">One More Animal:</label>
        <input id=""animal-3"" name=""animal-3"" type=""text"" required>
        <br>
        <label for=""adj-1"">Adjective (past tense):</label>
        <input id=""adj-1"" name=""adj-1"" type=""text"" required>
        
        <input type=""submit"" value=""Form My Story!"">


The id is binding to the for in the label. The name is captured by Submit and paired up with the input in the POSTDATA.

This is makes it clear to me! Thanks

yes, exactly. The value attribute is used to set the text (value) of a button. Then its common to use make the first letter of the first word upper case (normal grammar rules)

293,What does `id` and `name` do for an input tag?,"FAQ,HTML FAQ","forms,q-a",2,"
What is the point in adding id="""" and name="""" when it is irrelevant the feature itself? For example, on the section “How do you want your patty cooked?” the input is as follows: <input type=""range"" name=""doneness"" id=""doneness"" value=""3"" min=""1"" max=""5"">
However, take out those 2 and you still get the exact same functionality on the menu. The input could look like this:
<input type=""range"" value=""3"" min=""1"" max=""5"">
So is the name and id in this scenario simply for data we are retrieving?
","
The id could be a hook for some CSS  selector rule, it could be a hook for a JS element node to capture events, or it could be associated with a label. If neither of those apply, then it is not needed. As for the name, that is used to identify the user input in the POSTDATA on Submit.

295,Why can't I see the title of the website?,"FAQ,HTML FAQ",q-a,4,"
Question
Why can’t I see the title of the website?
Answer
The title element, <title>, gives the website a title that can be seen in the browser’s title bar or on the page’s tab. In the Codecademy editor we cannot see the browser’s title bar or the page tab. Try opening any link like https://www.codecademy.com/learn in a new browser window or tab. At the top of the new window or tab you’ll see some text - that text is the title of the website - the text between the opening, <title>, and closing, </title>, tags in the page’s HTML document.
","
sorry i didn’t understand what should i do to see the title to the website ?


Open the notepad of your operating system
Copy the following code into the notepad:

<! DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
   <title> This is the header of my website, here are things that are handled behind the scenes and the user does not usually see, except this title that I would like to see too. </title>
   <meta charset = ""utf-8"" />
   <link rel = ""stylesheet"" type = ""text / css"" href = ""main.css"">
</head>
<body>
   <h1> Everything that goes into the body of my website, regardless of the label I use, goes here inside the body and is what those who browse through it will see. </h1>

</body>
</html>


Save the file with the name you want and the extension .html, for example index.html
Open the file with your favorite browser and you will be able to realize that what is the title of the header.
*Good luck.Preformatted text



I think the reason is this editor is a browser within a browser. The problem with the inner browser is it doesn’t have a tab or title bar above it.
It would be useful if the Codecademy team would add it, so all learners can see the effect of adding a title to a webpage.

297,Whats the difference between max and maxlength?,"FAQ,HTML FAQ",forms,2,"
Hello, does anybody know why we are taught to write minlength/ maxlength in text areas, when as min/max is understood and renders the same. Is it a better code? Does it render differently in other browsers if it is not written minlength/maxlength in text areas?
thank you
","
Hello py
Notice that minlenght/maxlength and min/max serve different purposes.

Minlength and maxlength attributes specify the minimum and maximum number of characters allowed in the element.
Min/max attribute specify the minimum and maximum value (we are talking about cyphers here) for an element.

According to w3fools, “the max and min attributes works with the following input types: number, range, date, datetime, datetime-local, month, time and week.”

A slight tangent to the exercise here, but in the  element, there is a class=“overlay” attribute. What does this do?

Just FYI, in case it’s not been pointed out, the example code in the label says “Summarize your fillings.”  Fine if this is for a dentist’s website… but I assume you meant “feelings.”

What is the advantage of changing the style of the content using the em and strong tags within the HTML document, rather than making those changes as part of a CSS file?
I was thinking that CSS was used to change the style of the content and that HTML was used to present the bare-bones content of the webpage.
What’s the point of using these tags in HTML when there’s a whole system used to change a page’s style?
Thanks!

Is there a way to save my progress if I am in the middle of a lesson but need to leave the lesson?

Hi, if we want to style a text to make it italic and bold at the same time,
which tag we should write firstly, the em or the strong ?

I believe em and strong deliver a sense of importance to the browser, which CSS cannot convey in the same manner.

In Styling Text lesson, we learned about  and  tags. But can’t we use  and  tags instead of these tags. Then what is the main difference between these??

Hi, I was wondering how I use the required attribute in case I have put in a radio button input, checkbox input, dropdownlist, datalist input etc. Because there are a variety of inputs there.
Thanks in advance.

Hi,
How do we change the text of the validation message popup?
where did it fetch the popup content from as we didn’t enter it as part of the HTML code.

Does it matter if the “label element” or the “input element” comes first in writing code?  Is their a hierarchy?  I keep seeing them interchanged in hierarchical structure. But I also see the “” tag used too between the 2 elements, and I am wandering if that affects where text is displayed in the output if hierarchy does/doesn’t matter between the 2 elements?

The input box field of this exercise has arrows in it as if the attribute step had been used, but i do not see it in the code and I don’t understand how it shows up. Am I misunderstanding how the arrows are applied to an input? I’ve copied the  below:
<form action=""check.html"" method=""GET"">
       <label for=""guess"">Enter a number between 1-10:</label>
       <br>
       <!--Add the min and max attribute to the input-->
       <input type=""number"" name=""guess"" id=""guess"" required min=""1"" max=""10"">

So Section Tag is to enclose h1, h2, h3, etc with paragraphs that are related to the same theme.
So what about media tags or other types of HTML tags, works fine with the Section Tag?
When I know I need to use Div instead of Section?
Great Day.
","
All media tags work well with section. I’d recommend using section when ever you (like you stated) when you have a section. So put all your images, text, and videos related to that one section inside of the section tag. Then, inside the section, use things like aside, main, nav, and header. All these segments can be reused as long as they aren’t a part of the main html body.
I use div for sectioning off parts of the web page that don’t really have a name. So I’ll put it around a square block that I’m going to edit with JavaScript because the only reason I’m using it is to edit it with the id name.
That’s just my opinion though, honestly, it’s mostly just the way you decide to do it. I feel that everyone has a different way to incorporate semantic and the div tag, but I feel that is good practice to use semantic html tags as much as you can.




 stevencopeland:

So put all your images, text, and videos related to that one section inside of the section tag


What I understood I need to join all the images, text and videos that are related to a topic, for example, let’s say Cats, all my images about cats, statements in form of text about why the cats are mammals, videos about cats playing with wool go into a <section> tag because is the same theme that’s right?




 stevencopeland:

All these segments can be reused as long as they aren’t a part of the main html body


What you mean about this is: ""<section> can not be interchangeable with <body> and can not have all the space of <body>?
For Example:
<body>
   <section>
      this is wrong because use all the space of the body
   </sectio>
</body>

This above is right?

Two part answer. Yes, but only if you are talking about multiple animals. So lets say you’re talking about cats and everything about cats. That would be one section. Then you would have another about dogs, another about giraffes, and another about whatever.
But if you’re just talking about cats, I’d separate all your info into different sections. So
<section>
Cats cats cats
</section>
<section>
dogs dogs dogs
</section>
etc. etc. etc.

OR (like I said, the other option)
<section>
Cat brains
</section>
<section>
Cat Heads
</section>
<section>
Cat Size
</section>

That’s what I would do for this.



FAQ: Semantic HTML - Article and Section


What you mean about this is: "" <section> can not be interchangeable with <body> and can not have all the space of <body> ?


Yeah, although that’s technically ok, its bad practice.

So going off of your example, the html will be split into sections cats and dogs. How would you place articles? do you section off into cat food, health, training like sections of sections? Also, lets say you only had text for the chapters. no images, audio etc. Wouldnt putting articles inside the section be redundant if it only has paragraph elements?

So ok, if you had a page which talked about cats and dogs and it contains about each different animal, I would do something like this:
<section>
    <h1>Cats cats cats</h1>
       <article>
         <h2>cats?</h2>
            <p>Cats > Dogs</p>
       </article>
       <article>
         <h2>cats.</h2>
           <p>Cats eat fish</p>
       </article>
</section>
<section>
    <h1>Dogs dogs dogs</h1>
    <article>
         <h2>dogs?</h2>
         <p>Dogs > Cats</p>
    </article>
    <article>
         <h2>dogs.</h2>
         <p>Dogs eat meat</p>
     </article>
</section>

At least, this how I would build this personally.



 microace27095:

Also, lets say you only had text for the chapters. no images, audio etc. Wouldnt putting articles inside the section be redundant if it only has paragraph elements?


Well, we would assume that you would style the different articles, and adding headers and other things to make it different. So hopefully it would just be two articles right next to each other in plain text.

We must bear in mind that sectioning elements are essentially DIVs in sheep’s clothing. Some have default styles like lists and blockquotes, definition lists and paragraphs, etc. SECTION and ARTICLE are nothing more that DIV with a different name. Toss in ASIDE, MAIN, HEADER, FOOTER, etc. and we conclude the names mean something to both user agent and document readers (both human and assistive technology).
The purpose of markup is to document the document. In the past we would use generic containers (eg. DIV) to house the document content and give them IDs or CLASSes to distinguish their role.
id=""header""
id=""main""
id=""footer""

class=""article""
class=""section""

What’s more, in the past it was fairly assumed that more than one H1 in a page was faux pas. HTML5 opened the flood gates on how many topics could be covered in a single document bringing it more in line with multimedia (as in, magazines) in presentation.
The new paradigm permits multiple unique topics in one page. This means one H1 for each topic. Since it never makes sense to have more than one H1 in a topic, we have sectioning elements to contain them.
<section>
  <h1>topic heading</h1>
</section>
<section>
  <h1>topic heading</h1>
</section>
<section>
  <h1>topic heading</h1>
</section>

We are taught in grade school the importance of an outline when writing an essay. A web document is no less dependent upon the same concept when structuring one. Sectioning elements are the markup we employee to build the document within the given outline.
SEs understand document outlines, and give importance to a page if said outline is discernible.
Bottom line, if one has never written essays, then writing a web document is  unbridled. HTML being so forgiving, who knows what kind of GIGO will get past it? A well formed document passes the scrutiny of validation and accessibility grading and (one would hope) can be trusted to render in all devices.
There is no set pattern to follow that will optimize a page. It’s our document, and we have an idea of how we want it to present. Now it’s up to us to create that document outline, and then fill in the pieces. Once the markup is written and validated, then we can move on to presentation. It should be a breeze if we have a well formed document.
Finally, a SECTION can have multiple ARTICLEs, and vice-versa. We are the architects, the publishers. We define the roles.

A post was split to a new topic: What are all the attributes needed?


A few times throughout the video, Chelsea references ‘resources’ regarding this video that we can check out later. For example she said she would include the computerphile video in resources, and also we can check resources for more info on when we should use a div vs. a section element. Where exactly can I find these resources?

I am looking for the same answers as well.

Me too! Very confusing…

i am curious .What is the name of the text editor that codecademy uses ?

It’s very likely a licensed product designed for the type of embedding used in the Learning Environment and not something you or I could get our hands on without purchasing a license. Not a helpful answer, I know. A very similar environment is available for online at repl.it. It’s free to register.

Thanks for replying. Youu are kinda right

In the lessons and projects I do not see a vertical scroll in part of the webpage, so I do not see all the changes. How can I see the whole page?

The first phase mentioned <span> tags which are a block of tags. I didn’t get a chance to use <span>. Whats the difference between <span>, <p>, and <div> tags?

The greatest difference is between the SPAN and the other two. It is an inline element. The other are block level elements.
We can write a SPAN inside either of the other two, but not the other way around, unless we elevate the inline element to block level. This implies we are fully aware of the new behavior and placement.
The best use of SPAN is to isolate a word or phrase within a sentence so that it can be highlighted or emphasized, and/or given a title attribute so it has a tooltip.
<p>Wishing everyone <span title=""Good health"" lang=""FR"" style=""text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic"">Bonne santé</span>.</p>

We’ll come back to this. Block level elements all demonstrate the same basic qualities…

They reach across the entire viewport.
They have no height attribute
They inherit from their parent(s), the BODY and HTML

P has a special added style:
P {
    margin: 1em 0;
}

That means a P is just a DIV except they render with a blank line between. DIVs don’t have margins.

Now comes a practical exercise for you to perform in the JavaScript Console.
I use Chrome just because it is the one I’m set up for.
Open Chrome
In the location bar, type and entire, about.blank.
Bookmark this page on your Bookmarks Bar as, ‘about.blank’.
Now click the bookmark.
Ctrl + Shift + J gives us the JS console.
Let’s do some stuff at the input prompt, > …
 > body = document.querySelector('body')
<-     <body></body>
 > body.appendChild(document.createElement('p'))
<-     <p></p>
 > p = document.querySelector('p')
<-     <p></p>
 > p.innerHTML = ""Wishing everyone <span>Bonne santé</span>.""
<- ""Wishing everyone <span>Bonne santé</span>.""
 >  s = document.querySelector('span')
<-      <span>​Bonne santé​</span>​
 > s.style.textDecoration = 'underline'
<- ""underline""
 > s.style.fontStyle = 'italic'
<- ""italic""
 > s.style.fontWeight = '600'
<- ""600""
 > p
<-  >

Click on the arrow to expand the text node of P.
<p>​""Wishing everyone ""<span style=​""text-decoration:​ underline;​ font-style:​ italic;​ font-weight:​ 600;​"" title=​""Good health"">​Bonne santé​</span>​"".""</p>​

In one short lesson we have taken control of the DOM. Everything you learn from here on in will in one way or another by tied to this concept of manipulation.
We appended a P element to the document BODY. To that we inserted text and HTML. Then we styled the embedded HTML (SPAN)  Finally we added a title attribute to the same element. If we view the source, it looks like it was written by the page author in the raw document (sans quotes).

I forgot to mention, most importantly, watch the browser window in the console as we carry out the above command steps.

Are all these lessons based on HTML5? Thank you!

What we can say with certainty is that the lessons are all HTML. Much of what we use is essentially HTML 4. Given that browsers are staying on top of the emerging recommendations and have a hand in many of them, we can anticipate support for most new iterations of what is a living language.
Indeed, we do see the elements that came into use with HTML5, and there are lot of new elements with the jump from HTML 4. Few of them were any surprise, though since they basically evolved out of what was a regular practice for assigning roles to key segments.
<div id=""main"" class=""main"">

became,
<main>

Nothing changes in terms of the makeup of the element’s default style rules. It’s akin to saying,
<div type=""main"">

Something that has always existed in the HTML API is the ability to create elements. It follows right on the heels of XML. Trouble was that if a browser did not support (permit hooking by style sheet and script) the elements we created, there wasn’t much we could do with them.
HTML5 evolved within the same constraint. Browsers, most particularly Internet Explorer needed to be told that an element existed, and since it could not be told in the HTML, or the CSS, it had to be told in script. Using script to create the element definitions meant they could now be hooked by CSS and DOM script. Thank Remy Sharp for what became a universal implementation that enabled the crossover from HTML 4 to HTML5 during those tricky, spotty support times… html5shiv.js.
We are not likely to see this script in use, these days, though I wouldn’t doubt it is nestled away (in principle) in the core of a few frameworks, to this day.
It’s still a useful tool if we want to create our own elements, also not something to try, just yet. It’s not a requirement of HTML authors to invent elements. It’s a rabbit hole we don’t need to go down. Fun to know it’s there, though, isn’t it?
Vendors toyed with their own ideas for a considerable number of years. They shared their ideas through their own non-partisan working group and each created their own draft version. It’s what made it necessary to use ‘vendor prefixes’ on selectors, and use that vendor’s property declaration. We see it to this day in reams of legacy code either from the period, or still, in most cases, unnecessarily.
W3C had a big hand in all the proceedings, but only led their own group who were charged with examining the outpourings of the vendor group and seeing what could be reasonably and purposefully added to the specifications. It’s why we see the last selector rule always without a vendor prefix. It’s the W3C recommendation, and today, more than ever, vendors are sticking very close to the W3C line. In other words, we can almost depend upon it.
There are sites such as ‘caniuse’ and ‘quirksmode’, et al that may or will have current information on which browsers support which features. Ultimately, that is just a wee bit down the road in terms of where one would spend their time most effectively. Find them, and bookmark them, then back to learning!

Thank you for all the info! After moving alonog the lessons I’ve seen many of the HTML elements so I am glad we are learining righth from the most updated version. I am way out of the game of creating my own elements but hey, thank you for the insights into how this transition away from HTML4 came about.
Damian

You’re welcome. Don’t lose sight of the fact that HTML5 does not replace HTML 4, only extends it to incorporate more elements. HTML 4 will validate as HTML5 with some small exceptions such as obsolete attributes. Take an HTML 4.1 page and remove the DTD, and replace it with <!DOCTYPE html> then see if it validates at validator.w3.org.
Develop the habit of periodically validating your HTML so you get familiar with the  process and make it a commitment to never publish pages that are not validated. Search engines look favorably on pages that validate. As you continue to advance, seek out and test your documents in an outline checker (if one exists). For all we know there may be a tool right in the browser for this purpose.
Bookmark the HTML Elements section of the w3.org site. Keep it handy and study each new element as you learn them. Lastly, MDN is closely associated with W3C and WHATWG and likely the best go-to resource on the web for up to date information on description and usage. It will help you to interpret the specifications (recommendations) as published on the W3 site.

Not sure if it’s okay to post non-questions here but I noticed once I added the “name” attribute with the “username” value and ran the code, my LastPass browser extension populated the option to try auto-filling the text field. Guess that means one way they determine which fields might need to be filled is by looking for certain values under the “name” attribute? Pretty neat!

the questions i am trying to do are right but the website is counting them wrong. Why is that?

3 posts were split to a new topic: Why would a section element be placed inside an article element?

I have no question about the html in this lesson, but I needed to correct the mistake about the Cricket match example.
There are no Cricket games that go for 15 days, the longest type of game is Test Cricket and usually goes for 5 days. The longest Test Cricket game in history (between England and South Africa) went for 9 days.

8 posts were split to a new topic: How should multiple sections be used?

Looking at the example provided in the project 4/9 in “Learning Semantic HTML”:
Fun Facts About Cricket
A single match of cricket can last up to 15 days.
why is the h2 title “Fun Facts About Crickets” outside the article tag, when in the actual project and from hear on after titles are located inside the article tag??? It is tripping me out lol.

hii, please can i have more than one section on a page and if yes, how do i differntiate it particularly in css, would i have to give it an id or class{i m not through with css though}

Of course you can, and yes you’d style them using a specific class.
HTML

<section class=""favorite-cats"">
  // Everything about your favorite cats
</section>
<section class=""favorite-dogs"">
  // Everything about your favorite dogs
</section>

CSS

.favorite-cats {
  background-color: blue;
}
.favorite-dogs {
  background-color: yellow;
}

309,How do placeholders work?,"FAQ,HTML FAQ","forms,q-a",4,"
How placeholder works??
","
placeholder is an attribute, like value that will display in the input field. Unlike value, though, it is typed over and can be used in place of a label. It has no effect on the value that is POSTed.
<input name=""name"" placeholder=""Name"" value="""">
<input name=""email"" placeholder=""Email"" value="""">




 mtf:

It has no effect on the value that is POSTed.


We know that after submitting the form name=value is sent as pair. So, when we’ll add placeholder attribute then can we add value to the value attribute?



 mtf:



And if we’ll be able to add value then can we send the name=value pairs?

If you hard code a value, the placeholder will not display.
