Why are so many links giving 404?

This usually means the page does not exist anymore. I don’t see any links tho that are giving 404. You got some example links that are not working for you ?

IBM seems to have moved the external links within the course such as-
https://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/services-catalog.html
and
https://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/ibmwatson/developercloud/doc/getting_started/
Although this second link at least redirects you to the new IBM page.
Course seems to need some updates to to the linked URLs

I had copied this code on the exercises word for word - but when i get to part 6/8 i get this error:
Traceback (most recent call last):
File “CelebrityMatch.py”, line 6, in 
from watson_developer_cloud import PersonalityInsightsV2 as PersonalityInsights
ImportError: cannot import name PersonalityInsightsV2
Can anyone help?

Hi there!
I was having the same issue.  The version just needs to be updated.  Change the code from  ‘PersonalityInsightsV2’ to ‘PersonalityInsightsV3’.  You shouldn’t have any more issues after that.

Hi, I was working on this course but the content is out of date as IBM has updated the Personality Insights version. The newly created services use API and URL to authenticate. I made changes along to the way to update to the new version but got stuck towards the end because the Codecademy  page does not seem to accept the new authentication parameters as valid (keeps giving me an error and asking to complete my credentials). I had to stop towards the end of section 4 and could not move forward with the last chapter. Any plans of having this updated at some point?

I can’t go trough this exercise because this link:
https://www.codecademy.com/courses/ruby-intermediate-en-rUwFe/0/1?curriculum_id=5122d5f811fbdb5456005922
don’t work for me so I don’t have twitter API credentials.
Can somebody point me to the correct link?

And the link still isnt working - did you find another way to solve this

As previously noted, this exercise requires getting our Twitter User API settings.  The process  for how to get API settings is supposed to be at this embedded link:  https://www.codecademy.com/catalog/subject/all
but that link is to Codeacademy course catalog.  When I attempt to get the answers from the Twitter Developer discussions, nothing I found fits this code.
Disappointing since this seems like a fun exercise.

Having the same issue.  Wish they would read this and resolve it.

I figured out the Twitter API, but then there’s an issue with the Watson API:

CelebrityMatchDemo.py:36: DeprecationWarning: watson-developer-cloud moved to ibm-watson. To get updates, use the new package.


what’s the process to get the twitter API to work? Errors I get are below …
File “CelebrityMatchDemo.py”, line 75, in 
user_result = analyze(user_handle)
File “CelebrityMatchDemo.py”, line 27, in analyze
statuses = twitter_api.GetUserTimeline(screen_name=handle, count=200, include_rts=False)
File “/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/twitter/api.py”, line 812, in GetUserTimeline
data = self._ParseAndCheckTwitter(resp.content.decode(‘utf-8’))
File “/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/twitter/api.py”, line 4908, in _ParseAndCheckTwitter
self._CheckForTwitterError(data)
File “/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/twitter/api.py”, line 4928, in _CheckForTwitterError
raise TwitterError(data[‘errors’])
twitter.error.TwitterError: [{u’message’: u’Bad Authentication data.’, u’code’: 215}]
