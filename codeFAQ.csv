0,Coders under 13 years old,"FAQ,Codecademy FAQ",,29,"
Because of COPPA (Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act) restrictions, no persons under the age of 13 are allowed to participate on our forums. IF we notice or have suspicion that someone is under 13, we will email you and ask you to confirm your birthday within 24-48 hours. After that period, if you are either unable to confirm your birthday or if you do not respond, you will lose access to these forums.  Revocation of access to the Codecademy Discuss forums will not affect your ability to access learning content on codecademy.com.
Thank you,

To clear any confusion see here.
More specifics here.

@alexcommunitymgr what are we to do if we suspect someone as being underage?  Do we flag one of their posts, or is there a way to report them? Or do we just message a moderator?

@jibblyj I give them a link to this topic, and let them figure out what they want to do.
I’m not going to flag people for their age if I can at all help it, because I would’ve been practically heart-broken if someone had deleted my Codecademy account while I was under 13 (I’m old enough now, though).
If they’re acting inappropriately or goofing off excessively, then I might report them, but I don’t think age is any sort of a good reason to kick someone off of the forums if they’re acting maturely - and I’ve seen 30 year olds acting way less mature than people younger than them on here 
I’m glad that Codecademy is giving under-13s more freedom than they did when I first joined CC.

Ok I will do the same, thanks for the advice.

But this is completely illogical!!!
If you suspect someone is under 13, and you email them, but they happen to miss your email, or someone doesn’t check their email for a while (like a person like me, who checks emails once a week), and they don’t respond, YOU HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME IF YOU FIND THAT REASON TO DELETE THEIR ACCOUNT!!!
Wouldn’t it be more logical to simply block their access to the Q and A Forum, and not give them the option to enter the forum, until they confirm their age.
I am highly disappointed in you alex_bowen: Coding relies on immense faculties for logic, and understanding the possibilities of a situation. How can you think that this is fair and logical decision?
As famous tennis player John McEnroe coined the now famous phrase: YOU CANNOT BE SERIOUS!!! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekQ_Ja02gTY




 davidkovic:

That is exactly what happens. They are only blocked from the forums.

ummm…



 alex_bowen:

if you do not respond, we will delete your account.


Ur statement is in contradiction with what she said

She is only talking about the person’s forum account, not their codecademy.com account. She may have meant suspend or block instead of delete.  That is our normal procedure.

I think what @davidkovic wants to say is if you send an email to a person you suspect that is under 13 years old, this person can be not checking their emails regularly and if you delete their account when they didn’t even read this email and they didn’t have under 13 years old, then it will be illogical.




 miniapple8888:

and they didn’t have under 13 years old


Is this scenario you are thinking about:

someone posts in the forum that they are under 13
we send them a message/suspend their account
it turns out that they are not under 13 at all but were just kidding


@davidkovic https://discuss.codecademy.com/  and https://codecademy.com/ are different things.  You have an account for each, but they share some details.  Because you have an account for each, one of your accounts can be banned or suspended from the respective site if needed, and you will be able to access the other site still.
The general scenarios when we suspect that someone is below the legally required age are:
1.  They said that they were underage. (Most common)
or
2. Someone else said they were underage. (Much less common)
Depending on the scenario, we will act differently.
For scenario 1 we will usually look at their account to see if there is anything to hint their age, and look at their previous posts, and if it appears that they are underage, they will be suspended* from the site.
For scenario 2 we would have to do a lot more researching.  We would look at their account to see if it shows their age, look at their previous posts, and probably look at the profile of the person who told us about the underage person, to see if they have any relation to the potential underage child.  After this I assume a message will be sent to the user suspected of being underage, either on the forum, by email or both, and if there is no reply, or the user is underage, the account will be suspended.



 albionsrefuge:

it turns out that they are not under 13 at all but were just kidding


This shouldn’t be the case, but if it is and they get suspended, it’s their fault.  We could always message them to make sure, but if they get suspended for lying about their age then it is all down to them being childish.
*I say suspended because the accounts do not (normally) get perma-banned, but instead get temporarily banned from the site, usually until the user is old enough (e.g. if user is 12, suspended for 1 year, if user is 8, suspended for 5 years, etc.).

So if someone goes around, hypothetically, saying that people are under 13, and some portion of those people happen to not check their email, they could actually get banned!!! Plus, how does someone actually prove they are over 13? [quote=“alex_bowen, post:1, topic:8614”]
if you are either unable to confirm your birthday
[/quote]
What does it mean “confirm”? You just say you are 13? What if someone is lying, and what if someone keeps insisting someone else is under 13 when they are not, how do you settle the dispute? How will you determine whether the suspected junior should be kicked, or  punish the liar who is perpetrating an act worthy of in their own right, of being banned from the forum? This seems like a very shaky policy of Codecademy.
The reason I’m worried about this is that there are people who hate me on codecademy, whether in the closet or not, and it takes only one bad guy, out of the millions in codecademy, to get me out of codecademy forums (and in reality, anyone can have this possibility, because I’m sure I’m not the only one with enemies on this site).

I will try to get tighter wording together for this, it may take a few days.  I will say, that at this point, I don’t believe that there has ever been a case where someone else has pointed the finger at an underage user - unless it was to point at a post in which the underage user said that they were under age.

It’s not logical to regard something with indifference based off of the idea that it hasn’t been done before. It is very plausible and conceivable. You can easily, right now, go and post that someone is under 13, and there is a chance that they could get kicked. The only thing stopping you is that you’re not a bad person (I hope  ). But there are easily lots of bad people out there, everywhere, in almost every community and society. Thus, if such an occurrence does occur, it will be incredibly unjust if someone gets kicked because of such an easily conceivable, and avoidable situation. As an organization that is “committed to building the best learning experience inside and out”, and even itself admits that “Education is broken”, don’t you feel that it is your right to follow through with this loophole that has potential to harm many very good people who are eager to learn coding, and only desire good for all?

@davidkovic



 davidkovic:

It’s a very small chance. If we hear someone is under thirteen, we try to get more solid proof than just “oh, someone else said they were too young”. We understand that sometimes someone will get angry and do stupid stuff, so it’s highly unlikely we’d just ban someone based on one person saying so.
As I understand it, if we ask the user in question about their age, and they say they’re old enough, then that’s good enough for me. It’s not my job to make every one tell the truth (please do, though), and if they’ve deliberately mislead us, then it’s not our fault if we let them stay when they actually are too young.

It’s a practically nonexistent loophole. Again, we try to follow up with the user and if they don’t respond within a certain period of time, then it’s their fault (although I personally think a week is a little short). But also, if we ban them and they respond a few days later via email, then we can unban them.
I think you’re worrying a little too much about a problem that’s really not as bad as you think it is.

Codecademy Community FAQs on General Coding Questions.png1000×208 146 KB

Each exercise on Codecademy has a dedicated page for Q&A, all contained within our #faq category.
If you want to ask or answer a question about a particular exercise, simply reply to the topic that corresponds to the exercise you are working on.  The easiest way to find the right topic would be to click the “Community Forums” link in the left instructions pane on Codecademy.

Simply scroll down and hit the reply button ()  to contribute to that exercise’s FAQ.  If you have a question unrelated to a particular exercise, please post in #get-help instead and don’t forget to provide a link to what you’re working on so everyone else has context.
Over time, as questions get asked and answered, volunteer super user community members will take everyone’s replies to that thread and split them off into their own page in the “Get Help” category to make everything easier to read.  The link to those new threads will then be added to the FAQ list, and the top three of those links are then surfaced directly in the left pane on Codecademy.  It’s a virtuous cycle!
By asking and answering questions, you’ll help to build this resource for your fellow learners, so please contribute!

All coders get stuck, even professional ones!  Asking the right questions in the right way is a crucial skill for getting unstuck.  If you follow these guidelines, you’ll be far more likely to get helpful answers.


Do some light research before asking your question (and share anything relevant you find so that the next people with that question can find the answer faster)! You may find that you answer your own question, but even if you’re still stuck, you’ll be closer to an answer.  Don’t skip this step!


Write one sentence that summarizes your inquiry and place it in the title of your post.

Check spelling/grammar punctuation
Select a category and/or tags so your question is in the right place.
Pick a good, descriptive title about your problem.



Write in the body of the post to further clarify your question. Whenever possible always share the url to the exercise in question – without this, it’s really hard for other people to know what you’re talking about!  Always be clear, concise, and give context.


Post a code snippet (if applicable) that gets at the question you’re asking.  If you’ve written code that isn’t working, post that.

To ensure your code is properly formatted when copied into our forums, write 3 backticks (`) before your first line of code and after your last line of code.  See more info here.



Proofread your question!


Congrats! You’re ready to post your question!

4,What Language Do You Need to Know?,"FAQ,Codecademy FAQ",,2,"
This is a post by Eric Weinstein, creator of many Codecademy courses and a current student at Hacker School.
There’s a lot to learn when it comes to coding. How do you know where to start? Should you learn HTML or JavaScript? What’s the difference between Python and Ruby? What are “client-side” and “server-side” languages, “front end” and “back end” and how are they different? Hopefully this quick post will help you choose the language best suited for what you want to do.
To edit webpages
If you’re interested in creating a static website or a single webpage, you should start with Web Fundamentals of HTML and CSS. HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language and describes the structure of webpages. CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets, and controls their appearance — for example, the font color or the position of text on the page.
To make them interactive
If you want to give your website behavior—think automatic Twitter updates, your Facebook notifications, or the ability to drag and drop elements of your LinkedIn profile—then you’ll want to learn JavaScript and jQuery. JavaScript is a frontend, or “client-side” language which means it runs on the web browser of the person visiting your site. jQuery is a library of specific JavaScript tools designed to make website interaction more awesome.
To store user information
If you want to develop a full-blown web app that lets users log in and saves information for them (such as tweets, Facebook posts, or Codecademy badges), you’ll want to learn a backend, or “server-side” language like PHP, Python, Ruby or JavaScript (it’s ambidextrous). These languages run on the computer where the website code lives, also called the server. You can accomplish the same things and build the same kinds of projects with each of them, so go ahead and pick your favorite!

14,What is a streak?,"FAQ,Codecademy FAQ",,2,"
Your streak is the number of days in a row that you have completed an exercise on Codecademy.
It helps to practice regularly when learning any new skill, even programming. You’ll be surprised how much you can learn if you set yourself a goal. Pick a reasonable number of days - it’s okay to start small. Your streak is a little incentive to help you reach your goal.
If you are competitive you can compare streaks with your friends or you can work on setting personal bests. To help make it a habit, set a time in your schedule to code - like every day at lunch or over coffee or before you play your games or watch television.
Your streak will reset at midnight local time if you don’t complete an exercise at any point during the day. Don’t worry, it’s not the end of the world, your streak is just a tool in your coding adventure.

15,How Codecademy Checks Your Answers,"FAQ,Codecademy FAQ",,1,"
There are countless ways to write code that gets the job done, that performs a certain task.  Thus, there is not always a singular “right answer” to coding questions in general nor for Codecademy questions in particular.  How, then, does Codecademy assess what is right and wrong?  Codecademy uses multiple tools and tests to check whether your code is “correct” – something we call submission correctness tests or SCTs.
In brief:

We teach you and ask you to do something in a particular way, and then we test if you’ve done what exactly we expected you to do.
or

We are able to test the result of what you did and see if it “worked” even if you did so in an unusual way.

It isn’t always possible or advisable to follow the second route, particularly when there are multiple ways to solve a problem.  Occasionally, even if you happened to get a “right” answer, the way that you got that right answer could lead to some unexpected problems further on in the course.  Given that there are so many ways to potentially solve a problem and we can’t write courses based on infinite branching possibilities for code, we use a combination of the two tests.  For more info about how this works, read on.
Linting
Linting is the running of a simple program that will check your code for some common, potential, or predictable errors.  This may include things like not ending a tag or including a semicolon.  A lint program is what will return details for many of your potential missteps with code whether you’re a beginner or an advanced programmer – you’ll find linting tools in many of your favorite text editors like Atom or Sublime Text.
Output Tests
For many tasks, Codecademy is able to assess what your code produces as an output, comparing that with what we’d expect to see with what we asked you to produce.  This can be a powerful tool, but it is also a limited one.  When there are numerous methods of getting code to do the thing you want to do, it can mean that your code can evolve in a very different way than many other coders’ work, which would give us, over time, an unmanageably large set of potential code solutions to account for when designing our curriculum.  If you have multiple steps within a single exercise, we’re probably using this kind of test to assess your answers before you make it to the next exercise.
For example, let’s say that you are on the second checkpoint of a React exercise, below:

c9b832d7839ad736f3b359467315001ba7937dce.png1282×2244 387 KB

For the kinds of tests that happen before the final question in this exercise, there may be no single “answer code” that we are testing your submission against, just the output.  This also means that you can often tinker with your code or make large rewrites and still move to the next checkpoint so long as the output that we are checking remains the same.  It is also useful to note that, hypothetically, there may be ways to write code that ‘pass the tests’ but aren’t correct per the instructions.  Given that you could tweak your code infinitely in this manner, in ways that could affect future exercises, we need another method to keep everything orderly.
Code Tests
The final check Codecademy uses is to verify a single “right answer.”  For this, there is an “answer code” – we want to make sure you wrote the code in a very specific way.  This test checks the code that you’ve written, not just that code’s output.  What we’re looking for here is the code that we would have expected you to write if you followed all of our instructions to the letter.  This test does allow for some variations, for example if we ask you to enter your name on line 12, we aren’t expecting that everyone will enter the exact same string .  When you press the get code button, we replace your code with the code that we are looking for, thus enabling you to pass the exercise.
Note that this “answer code” will get you past the final checkpoint, but it won’t always allow you to pass all the previous checkpoints one by one.  Part of the reason for this is that sometimes those checkpoint instructions ask you to make changes that aren’t reflected in the final code by the time you get to the last checkpoint – for example in checkpoint two you may be asked to revert a change you made in checkpoint one.  This is also a major reason why when you press the get code button you are automatically passed through all of the checkpoints in an exercise.

Not using a verified account: please login with a verified account, such as your email, facebook or other social media channel. This helps with security and ease of logging in. You also may have used a verified account the first time, not your email or vise versa.


Some people have also experienced log in issues because they are actually clicking “Sign Up” instead of “Log In”, or vise versa. Just check to make sure you are on the correct page.


If you logged in/created your account in a certain language, such as English, that you are logging into an English page again. Users have had issues when, for example, their original login was made in Portuguese-br website and they were trying login into English version.


“Email address is already in use” is a common error when you are trying to login with an existing email account in the “sign up” area on accident. Or, you are trying to “sign up” with an email that is already taken.


-“Email Invalid” means that the email you are entering is not formatted correctly. What that usually means is it’s not a full email. i.e. a correct email format is “something@blah.com” and you may have only entered something@ and forgot the blah.com
-Using the incorrect username, or misspelling your username.

22,How do I format code in my posts?,"FAQ,Codecademy FAQ",,2,"
Codecademy Discuss posts are parsed with Markdown. Markdown allows for easy formatting of code and text, and strips HTML out of posts by default to prevent security risks. This will show you how to format your code so it shows up.
Summary
To format code so it’s visible, either wrap it in single backticks for a small amount of code, or triple backticks on an otherwise blank line before and after for a large amount of code.
Details
Inline code
To indicate a small span of code, wrap it in backticks (`). For example:
How do I use the `console.log()` function?

would produce:
How do I use the console.log() function?
Code Blocks
Toolbar Icon
Using Preformatted Text icon on the toolbar

Screenshot (29)_LI.jpg701×104 15.8 KB

This will automatically create a code block which you can paste your code in.

Or select your code and then press the icon.
Manually
To indicate a code block, either wrap the entire block in three backticks:
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <!-- metadata and external resources-->
  </head>
  
  <body>
    <!-- page content -->
  </body>
</html>
```

Or you can indent the code with four (4) spaces:
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
      <head>
        <!-- metadata and external resources-->
      </head>
      
      <body>
        <!-- page content -->
      </body>
    </html>

The first produces:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <!-- metadata and external resources-->
  </head>
  
  <body>
    <!-- page content -->
  </body>
</html>

The second produces:
<!DOCTYPE html>

If you want to chat about general things unrelated to any particular course, post in community. Within this sub-category, you’ll find everything “off-topic” that isn’t covered by other categories.
If you have any account-related questions, you may find an answer in our Support category. If you don’t find what you’re looking for within this category, our help desk or support team will have an answer for you!

If you’re seeking out code-specific discussion about any particular subject taught on Codecademy, Get Help will be the category where you’ll want to ask or answer questions.  If you’d prefer instead to more broadly discuss a language or framework, join the conversation in the General Programming sub-category.

31,How to answer a question,"FAQ,Codecademy FAQ",,1,"
If you think you can answer a question, don’t hesitate to do so! Answering questions is an excellent way to both elevate the understanding of the Codecademy community and confirm your own understanding of a concept. We encourage you to do so as you much as you can! When answering questions, please follow these guidelines:

You can find the most recent posts/threads by looking at the ‘Latest’ posts from our Forums homepage. You aren’t limited to this section, it’s just a good place to start!

Find a question that you think you can answer well.

Read the question thoroughly before writing a response.

Reply directly to the question by clicking  and provide a carefully considered response.

Proofread your response so that it’s coherent AND respectful.

Post your reply and await a response!

For how to best ask a question, see here.

32,User Trust Levels,"FAQ,Codecademy FAQ",,7,"
This post was based on the original post on Discourse Meta here.

As documented in Community Building on the Web.
User trust levels are a way of…

Sandboxing new users in our community so that they cannot accidentally (or intentionally!) hurt themselves, the forum, or other users while they are learning what to do.
Granting experienced users more rights so that they can help maintain and moderate the community they generously contribute so much of their time to.

The User Trust Levels we offer:
0 → 1 (Learner) → 2 (Rising Star) → 3 (Moderator: Codecademy Moderator, (Pro) Advisor, Super User, Staff) → 4 (Administrator)
We also have a Badge called Codecademy Team Member. That badge is reserved for those who work for Codecademy.
Let’s break it down!!
Users at trust level 0 (New member) cannot…

Send private messages to other users
Reply as new topic in the right gutter (UI removed)
Flag posts
Post any images
Post any attachments
Post more than 2 hyperlinks in a post
Have actual links in the ‘about me’ field of their profile (will be silently and temporarily converted to plain text)
Mention more than 2 users in a post

Keep scrolling down to learn about other trust levels!
","
Level 1: Learner
What it means to us: You are an up-and-comer who is newer to the forums and/or developing your product knowledge.
What it means to Discourse: If you stick around long enough to read a bit, Discourse now trusts you as a basic user.
They can get to trust level 1 by…

entering at least 3 topics
reading at least 15 posts
spend a total of 6 minutes reading posts

Users at trust level 1 can…


use all core Discourse functions


Upload images and attachments if enabled


Edit wiki posts


Flag posts


have all new user restrictions removed



Level 2: Rising Star
What it means to us: You are a member and have jumped into one of the many forum posts, answered a question, and participated in existing conversations. You have also posted a new thread, or at least thought about it. You now are turning your focus on your posting style, quality of answers, and relationships with Top Contributors and Rising Stars.
What it means to Discourse: Members keep coming back to the site, and have participated long enough to earn complete citizenship.
They can get to trust level 2 by…

visiting at least 15 days, not sequentially
casting at least 1 like
receiving at least 1 like
replying to at least 3 different topics
entering at least 20 topics
reading at least 100 posts
spend a total of 60 minutes reading posts

Users at trust level 2 can…


Use the “Invite others to this topic” button for one-click onboarding of new users to participate in topics


Invite outside users to PMs making a group PM



Level 3: Super User
What it means to us: You are one of the most knowledgeable and active forum participants and have been active in the forum continuously.
What it means to Discourse: Regulars are the most active readers and reliable contributors over long periods of time. Getting to level 3 is time and activity based, unlike the previous levels. In the last 100 days…

must have visited at least 50% of days
must have replied to at least 10 different topics
of topics created in the last 100 days, must have viewed 15% of posts created in the last 100 days, must have read 15%, must have received 50 likes, and given 50 likes. (These likes must be across a minimum number of different users (1/5 the number), across a minimum number of different days (1/4 the number). Likes cannot be from PMs.)

must not have received more than 5 spam or offensive flags (with unique posts and unique users for each, confirmed by a moderator)
must not have been suspended

All of these must be true.

Unlike other trust levels, you can lose trust level 3 status. If you dip below these requirements, whether from flagging or the passage of time, you will be demoted to Member. However, in order to avoid constant promotion/demotion situations, there is a 2-week grace period immediately after gaining Trust Level 3 during which you will not be demoted.

Users at trust level 3 can…

recategorized and rename topics
have all their links followed (we remove automatic nofollow163)
spam flags cast on TL0 user posts immediately reach the action threshold

Our criteria for choosing Top Contributors may change over time as we learn what truly makes a Top Contributor “the tops.”

Level 3+: Codecademy Moderator
When you’re not answering questions in the forums, you might be testing new features or advocating for product changes. Codecademy Moderators are Super Users that are meant to be mostly made up of Community. (All Moderators are Super Users, but not all Super Users are Moderators.) You must be a consistent Super User in order to be considered for a Moderator position. Moderators get swag and other awesome benefits 
If you are interested in becoming a Moderator, I would like to suggest that you try to earn the “Super User” Badge, which gives you Level 3 access, almost as much as a moderator, first to then be considered for a “promotion”. We do consider promotions without having the Super User badge, but getting that is almost like a right of passage, if you will, and helps make our decision easier.
Some qualities you have as a Codecademy Moderator:


Helpful: Each Codecademy Moderator answers thousands of questions to educate and help others, to foster community engagement, and to influence the future of Codecademy’s products.

Knowledgeable: Codecademy Moderators are trusted partners, connecting regularly with Codecademy to stay in-the-know about new and improved product features.

Technical: Codecademy Moderators know the ins and outs of Codecademy’s products. Many Codecademy Moderators specialize in a specific product, while others share their expertise across several forums (and sometimes across several languages)

Provide help and advice to new users, help forum newbies, and anyone interested in learning more.
The Moderator should have related coding experience and have knowledge around the Codecademy courses and products.
The Moderator should have enough spare time for forum modding! (We don’t request you log-in every day, just give some spare time to keep the forum in order and help other users)

Theme control: The moderator must create an open discussion atmosphere in the forum he/she moderates, trying best to write posts, transfer relevant articles and reply to users’ questions. It is the moderator’s responsibility to establish and keep the forum style and theme according to the board layout.

Maintain order: The moderator must mediate irrational quarrels occurred in the forum he/she moderates to maintain normal order. The moderator should take a neutral stand and pose a fair attitude in settling disputes, particularly when involved in controversial topics.

Keep forum clean: Monitor your assigned forum for abusive posts, unauthorized spam or advertisements, copyright infringements, any sort of harassment, and any other violations of the forum rules and edit or delete posts that violate these rules.

Increase forum popularity: Foster a sense of community, caring and responsiveness in your assigned forum. This can be done easily by getting involved in discussions, responding to posts (especially those no one else responds to), and offering your support. NOTE: You do not have to reply to every post. This is especially crucial for new and inexperienced users to feel welcome.

Becoming a Codecademy Moderator is invite only.  Our team monitors the Forum closely and periodically extends invitations to those who emanate the Super User attitude as identified above.

Level 3: Pro Advisor
Pro Advisors
Advisors are Pro only support staff online on the forum on in our courses on codecademy.com to help with debugging, code reviews, and more. Advisors will also work with you to determine the best way to go through your path recommending other resources and making sure all your questions about your learning journey are answered. Our Advisors are very familiar with our content and can help you with any issues from beginner to more advanced.
Advisors are eager to help out when you need it. Advisors can:
• Recommend extra resources
• Help with tech issues & questions

You also get access to extra resources and projects to take your skills and learning to the next level.

Level 4: Administrator
Those in this level are a few members of the Codecademy team who help moderate, edit and clean up the Forum. They keep up the maintenance of the architecture and keep the quality up.
They can get to trust level 4 by…

Working for Codecademy or proving yourself to be an outstanding “Heroic” Moderator.
