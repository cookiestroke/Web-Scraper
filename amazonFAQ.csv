I used the fact skill template, and had slots
Animals: cats, birds, and dogs,
Answers: 4, 2, small, both, bark, meow, and chirp
Here is my code below

When I paste the ARN for my Lambda function into the Default box and click Save Endpoints I get this Error message:

I don’t see ‘JSON Input’ or ‘JSON Output’ in test tab. I only see ‘Skill I/O is available only for speech requests to skills you have created.’ (which is seen in the video as well but disappears once there is a request)
I do get output for what’s asked in the Simulator tab but, don’t see the text content to view request and response.

i am facing a similar problem, did you manage to find a fix for it? i presume its because we didnt actually implement the lambda function ourselves but rather just copied the ARN endpoints.

Hello
When I input >> “tell code academy hello”
I get this reply >> “I solemnly swear I am up to no good, White Family”
I checked all my current enable skills and the only one that is active is the one I created in this exercise but is called > White Family
I disabled this skill and repeated this exercise 3 times and this is what I get.
Also I get this >>Skill I/O is available only for speech requests to skills you have created.is >> "" and >> “previous rendered templates are not available to view.” on the Json and Lambda boxes.
Is this normal?
thanx

Yep, same problem. Any answer on this?

Bump, same issue here

Hey @mr.replicant, @nejjy, and @bytecoder84128, thanks for reporting! I’m a Curriculum Developer here and I’d like to help out.
Before fixing anything, I need to reproduce the issue. Could you each share:

The exact ARN you are using on the developer portal

The JSON code shown under “JSON Editor”
The utterance you typed to get that response


Here are mine:


The exact ARN you are using on the developer portal You can find this under the Endpoint page
arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:151096212661:function:codecademyLearnAlexaIntro-ii


The JSON code shown under “JSON Editor”
nicks_model.txt (1.0 KB)


The utterance you typed to get that response
“tell code academy hello”



I am receiving the same so I decided to push through to the next lesson: “Create a New Intent”, but I believe that has been altered as well. When testing “ask code academy what’s my favorite language”, it returns no content. Can we get a notification when the course is back online? Thanks!

And here are mine as well:
ARN being used: arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:151096212661:function:codecademyLearnAlexaIntro-ii
JSON being used: https://justpaste.it/3m6l8
Utterance that returns odd response: “open code academy”, “tell code academy hello”

Thanks @bytecoder84128! I found the issue and I’m working with the Alexa team to fix it.

Any updates on “Skill I/O is available only for speech requests to skills you have created.” ? Still not able to see the JSON input / output

I was experiencing the same problem and came here hoping to find an answer. I looked at the list of enabled skills on my amazon account and found one entitled “White Family Code Academy”. I disabled it from my alexa phone app as I couldn’t get it to disable from the web broswer. After it was disabled my own changes to the lambda response was recognized. Hopefully the Code Academy team can figure out a permanent solution but I thought I’d let you know how I got around it.

I don’t see the “White Family Code Academy” skill listed in my account but I’m still getting “I solemnly swear I am up to no good, White Family” as a response.
I was hoping it was a quick fix but no luck as of yet.

I have the same issue - I don’t understand why there is still reference to White Family? did you solve the problem?

@nduckwiler
Guys, I had the same issue only showing me ‘Skill I/O is available only for speech requests to skills you have created.’
I figured out the reason behind this error.
My anti-virus software, avanst was blocking all the connections that the Alexa simulator was attempting to do in the browser.
You can check it out from the dev tool in your browser.
There’s a bunch of errors with access denied.
Just turning off the web shield from avanst worked.
Now, I see the response from the test and JSON response as well.

Hi All, I just figured out why we keep getting the white family code academy responses. It looks like someone, presumably the White family, created a public skill that’s essentially identical to the one we build in our lessons. So that skill keeps getting triggered rather than the one we’ve built.
You can disable the white family codeacademy skill by telling Alexa “disable white family code academy” in the test tab or on your Alexa device. Once it’s disabled your skill will work.

Hey all!
Issue 1: White Family Code Academy
It sounds like a number of people are having the “White Family Code Academy” issue, including @bitwhiz35879, @sjnelson919gmail.com, @wannerj44, and @n8tedoggyt5966891611.
While I work on a permanent solution, there are two workarounds:

Like @n8tedoggyt5966891611 said, disable that White Family skill:


It looks like someone, presumably the White family, created a public skill that’s essentially identical to the one we build in our lessons. So that skill keeps getting triggered rather than the one we’ve built.

Change the name of your own skill. Instead of “code academy”, try something unique like “nick first project” or “super fabulous highly effective machine”. It’s silly I know, but it means that Alexa won’t accidentally find a skill with a similar name.

Issue 2: Anti-virus software
There is another problem that @schabibi had, in which anti-virus software was blocking the Alexa simulator. You might be experiencing this if you receive a message: “Skill I/O is available only for speech requests to skills you have created.”…I’m having trouble reproducing this one myself, but @schabibi solved it by disabling the anti-virus software.

response


My suggested fix to the first issue (use a unique invocation) is now added to the lessons! You’ll see that the lessons now ask you to use an invocation like “Nick D’s code academy” instead of the generic “code academy”.

I tried to follow this exercice.
I put this code into my lambda function on AWS  :
""use strict"";

var Alexa = require(""alexa-sdk"");

var handlers = {
  'LaunchRequest': function() {
    this.response.speak(""Hello, Welcome to Codecademy. What do you think is Codecademy's most popular language?"").listen(""Tell me what you think is Codecademy's most popular language."");
    this.emit(':responseReady');
  },

  'LanguageIntent': function () {
    this.response.speak(""Python is our most popular language."");
    this.emit(':responseReady');
  },
}

exports.handler = function(event, context, callback){
    var alexa = Alexa.handler(event, context);
    alexa.registerHandlers(handlers);
    alexa.execute();
};

I associate it with my Alexa skill using the ARN but when I test it (just say : “open Popular Language”, which is the waking word of my skill), the only response I get is :

There was a problem with the requested skill’s response

Does someone knows why I can’t launch my skill ?

Same problem, do you figure it out?

If somebody could give more detailed instructions on how to copy the code over that would be amazing.

Hello !
I don’t know if that have anything to do with it but when I was doing some research on Internet I found that :  This version of the Alexa Skills Kit SDK is no longer supported. Please use the v2 release found here: https://github.com/alexa/alexa-skills-kit-sdk-for-nodejs
Source : https://www.npmjs.com/package/alexa-sdk
So I guess there are some changing to do on all the lesson… I’m trying something and I’ll let you know if it works

Hey !
You should watch here : https://developer.amazon.com/fr-FR/docs/alexa/custom-skills/handle-requests-sent-by-alexa.html#listen-and-reprompt

if everyone could look into it I would really appreciate… thanks so much!

Hey alfredo, I know this is a super late response to your question, but I just stumbled across the same issue and believe I figured out why it happens at least. The problem is that the Inroduction to Alexa series was initially published with the older Alexa SDK and now the first two courses have been update to the newer version, while the later two have not been. The course requests that we use a serverless app repository blueprint that no longer seems to exist in the repo. So, long story short, we either have to wait for the course to be updated or read up on the GitHub documentation (linked here ).

Thank you a ton! I’ve been stuck on the last bit for hours now trying to figure out if I was using the wrong template or missing a semi-colon somewhere. Would really like an update soon, this is very hard to learn without being able to test.

Thanks for you answer. I am having the same issue and cannot figure out what happened. Good to know, and wish to see the update.

Hello,
My Alexa language is set to French by default, since I live in France. I cannot have access to the skill, since the ARN is set to US … What shall I do?
Thanks,
