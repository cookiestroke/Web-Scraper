1,Unable to print the correct working directory in the right location,"Get Help,Command Line","general,navigating-file-system",6,"
I’m on the Bicycle World project for cmd and it is asking me to:

Print the working directory.  If you ever get lost, you can return to this directory using cd.

It should output
/home/ccuser/workspace/bicycle-world-ii

But when I run
pwd

or I try to navigate to /home/ccuser/workspace/bicycle-world-ii, it fails saying no such file or directory.  Did I miss a step somewhere?
","
You ran pwd entirely by its self?
How about using cd .. to try moving back a directory?

@8-bit-gaming
here is the hint:

Check your spelling on the directory you are trying to go to.

cd /home/ccuser/workspace/bicycle-world-li
                                        ^



Classic!  Well I’m more aware now thank you 

A single mistyped character can certainly get in the way.
I have spent upwards of half an hour trying to find an error in my code, just to find one mistyped variable 
Sometimes you gotta step back and look for the small things.

Have I wasted $240?


I’m not sure-I’m only a user like you-but if you’ve paid for it, you could continue with the path you’re doing. If you have any questions, the forums are the best place to ask! @SuperUsers, would you agree?

Hi @progresspanda
The help forums are run by volunteers.
What is your specific question about the command line project that you linked above? Perhaps someone can chime in and help…




 progresspanda:

No answer from the “contact us” page.


Do be paitent. I believe it usually takes about 48 hours to get an answer. Also remember that there may be many requests that come in every day, so yours may not be the first one on the list.
Though that does not mean they won’t answer.
I second @codeneutrino and @lisalisaj, we are volunteers, but we help to the best of our ability.
What question do you have about the command line?




 codeneutrino:

if you’ve paid for it, you could continue with the path you’re doing.


I also agree, if you spent that amount than I believe you have purchased the whole year of pro.
If so, than there are many courses and paths available to you if you have an interest in them.

Yeah but if I can’t learn one thing faster than this it’s not of much value.
 source ~/.bash_profile 
Welcome, Joe Nertz
 alias pd= “pwd”
bash: alias: pwd: not found
$ alias pd= “pwd”
environment lesson.   this always happens when I try to write an alias.  I did it right because I copied and pasted the command.

It looks like there’s a gap (at least in what you used in that message) between the equals sign and what you are assigning which means it will treat it like a command. Get rid of those gaps.

 pwd
/home/ccuser/workspace/music
 alias pd=“pwd”
$ alias pd=“pwd”
no gaps this time.  hit save and it repeats the last line as you see here

Is that after using source ~/.bash_profile ?

yes
 source ~/.bash_profile 
Welcome, Joe Nertz
 alias pd= “pwd”
bash: alias: pwd: not found
 alias pd= ""pwd""
bash: alias: pwd: not found
 alias pd=“pwd”

 pwd
/home/ccuser/workspace/music
 alias pd=""pwd""
 alias pd=“pwd”
$ alias pd=“pwd”

Exactly how does your bash profile look? Is that all on a single line? Each new command should be on a newline if not separated by ;. Try wrapping it in triple backticks like so if you post it to the forums, ta-
` ` `
script goes here
` ` `

no, it’s not on a single line.  that’s just copied and pasted to make it quick.  all the lines start where you’d normally expect them to, like after the $ sign in most cases

What does the .bash_profile file itself look like? It should be roughly like below (nano editor) but with the relevant pd alias and such.
profilesnip816×292 2.07 KB

this is what I did at the top 
 source ~/.bash_profile 
Welcome, Joe Nertz
 alias pd= “pwd”
bash: alias: pwd: not found
that’s exactly what it looks like

or rather like this :
source ~/.bash_profile
Welcome, Joe Nertz
alias pd= “pwd”
bash: alias: pwd: not found

It looks like there there still a single whitespace in that file between pd= and “pwd” (pd= ""pwd"" gives me an identcal warning). Can you edit the file again and remove that whitespace so that the second line reads as alias pd=""pwd"" and try source again?




 progresspanda:

source ~/.bash_profile


 source ~/.bash_profile
bash: /home/ccuser/.bash_profile: No such file or directory


Rather than hunt it down perhaps it’s easiest to rewrite that particular file at the given location.

I don’t understand…

3,Setting up SQLite on Mac - .schema not working,"Get Help,Command Line",general,6,"
https://www.codecademy.com/articles/what-is-sqlite
I am on a mac. As per linked article, downloaded and installed sqlite. Downloaded and installed acs-1-year-2015.sqlite database as instructed. All saved to desktop (in a folder titled SQL Related).
Changed directory to Desktop (cd Desktop) from terminal. That is perfect.
Theresas-iMac:Desktop theresaraegay$ was my command line and I typed
sqlite3 acs-1-year-2015.sqlite and clicked enter.
This came up. I think it is right?
SQLite version 3.28.0 2019-04-15 14:49:49
Enter “.help” for usage hints.
sqlite>
So, as directed, I typed .schema. Nothing happened.
I typed .help and received a full list of help areas so it is working.
Thoughts? Not sure what to do if I cannot see schema of DB.
Thank you -
","
Hi, welcome to the forums 
It’s been a long time since I’ve done this setup from CC (but I do use Sqlite so I can help a little).
This might be a silly question, but are you sure the file has a schema? If you have DB Browser (there’s a version for mac) you can visually browse the database to verify this.

@object9507334711,
It sounds like you probably created a database called acs-1-year-2015.sqlite rather than opening the one you have.  That would mean there are no tables to show, and hence, no schema.
The reason this would happen is because when SQLite tries to open a database file, if that file is not where you tell SQLite to look, SQLite will create a database file with the name you supplied at that location.  So, always make sure you open your command line to the same folder as your database file in order to avoid this in the future. 

That makes sense, I didn’t think of it not being in the same folder … 

I am following the directions from that linked page. He says to type it and he shows what happens when he does. Mine doesn’t.

Like @el_cocodrilo points out it’s probably a file location issue then.
A way you can make sure you’re on target it to type ls in the directory where you are and confirm that the file you want to open is there. I would re-download the file at this point to make sure that it’s the original and not one that sqlite created by default. (Conversely, you can check if it’s the right one with DB Browser, again, highly useful tool).

You could try wrapping the expression with quotation marks. Singles would do for this query.
Alterantively did you use the absolute path as per the instructions? Navigating to that directory and using grep -R will only give you the relative paths from your current working directory.

Hey there @progresspanda!
The project works fine for me.
I typed pwd and /home/ccuser/workspace/clothing was printed.
My first thought would be to check what browser you are using. Codecademy recomends using Chrome or Firefox. Troubleshooting Guide

Did that. No difference in result.
4CE153FFE0964963A80F886FAC06FB5E.png708×1 82 Bytes

Very odd indeed, have you tried everything in the Troubleshooting Guide?
Such as clearing browser caches and seeing if any extensions are interferring with Codecademy.

I’d be very interested in knowing where this “troubleshooting guide” is.
However, I’m far more interested in the “Contact Us” page.   I’ve already ascertained that I can’t get my $240 back but the least they deserve is a nasty letter.  How do you learn anything when it glitches so much?

I posted a link to it a few posts back,  here it is again though: Troubleshooting

How long ago did you contact CC? If I remember correctly they attempt to respond within 48 hours.

As I said earlier, I cannot find any such thing as a Contact Us page.

The link to the help page is located in the footer on the main page.
You can click this link though.
In the top right corner is a blue button that says ‘Contact Us’

I found the link to CC just now. Now I can take it up with them and it won’t be pretty. Thanks very much for your assistance.

Me also. If anyone finds out please post.

Actually I just had the idea of using
npx surge

as the command because npx is the new package executor. We installed but then needed to execute.

Nice solution @alangervin3193293788 !!

I know this was marked as solution but I wanted to correct information I posted and I don’t see an edit button on my answer unless I delete it. npx actually stands for node package executor not new package executor.

 progresspanda:

Also, what does it mean when the instructions say “echo so and so”?


Echo is a command that, if I recall correctly, will be explained at some point in the course. It takes in string(s) as input and outputs (echoes) them as standard output, which will be explained in the Redirection lesson. For now, you can check out the link below.

echo (command)

 In computing, echo is a command that outputs the strings it is being passed as arguments. It is a command available in various operating system shells and typically used in shell scripts and batch files to output status text to the screen or a computer file, or as a source part of a pipeline.

Try it! See what happens 

It keeps saying command not found.

What happens if you just alias, or just export?

Well, if I use just alias, after I run source ~/.bash_profile~, I can use src_bash. I haven’t tried export let me see how that works. Ok so after trying it works the same if I were to just use alias.

Problem solved then, yea?

The answer is no right? What if I make an enviroment variable called src_bash and make an alias for that? Is that possible?

You’d have to go a bit further and search the differences between export and alias. You can’t do both at once. There’s plenty of discussion of that sort of stuff on stackoverflow if you search export vs alias.

https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-the-command-line/lessons/command-line-manipulation/exercises/cp-ii

It keeps passing the steps, even though said code is wrong.
The steps say wrong even though what I’m doing is right.

For example, they asked me to navigate to the  comedy/  directory, so I typed cd comedy, (and yes, I was in the right directory), and then I typed pwd, which printed: /home/ccuser/workspace/movies/comedy, so I’m in the right place, but it’s saying I’m wrong.
Apparently, the correct code to go to comedy/ is cd …/…/comedy, which prints: No such file or directory. It doesn’t make sense.
Maybe I’m just making a mistake, but this is really tripping me up.
","
I found more than once that trying to follow the exact instructions for the directory traversal would lead to errors. I couldn’t work out if that was intentional to get you to work out your current location for yourself or just a mistake. If it’s meant to be an instruction then it should be correct and if not then it seems odd to provide a command of cd../../comedy rather than just asking you to move to the comedy directory if you’re meant to work it out for yourself.
On this and a few other lessons with the same or similar errors I think you can get away with just moving out of the current directory and then immediately moving back to actually get the requirement passed.

Ok thanks. I hope this gets fixed soon.

Given I am new to the command line, but from what I understand, you can’t use  cd to move to a file unless you specify the file pathe leading to it, or you are in the directory that contains it.
When you used pwm it says you are in:
/home/ccuser/workspace/bicycle-world-ii/freight/porteur
Which would mean you can not move to freight by using cd freight.

Aye, it sounds like you’re in a directory you don’t expect so simply trying cd to the name won’t work. As per @8-bit-gaming’s suggestion use pwd  to work out what directory you’re currently in. After that a mix of using ls to list the files in a given directory and  changing directory with cd should get you where you need to go (remember that cd .. will move you to the parent directory so you don’t have to use absolute paths).

I give up. This is no help at all. I type it in exactly as t he walk through shows and I get “no such file”
4CE153FFE0964963A80F886FAC06FB5E.png708×1 82 Bytes

Don’t give up on it. It seems you are simply in the wrong directory.
If you use pwd and it says you are in
/home/ccuser/workspace/bicycle-world-ii/freight/porteur
Than you just need to change your working directory.
You can use cd .. to move back a directory until you get back to:
/home/ccuser/workspace/bicycle-world-ii
You should be able to work the project from there.

Thank you very much for your help. I was totally stuck.

bash_profile is invoked when we login. So what you want, is already happening. The reason we use source is so we load the changes we made without having to logout/login or reboot.

Okay! It’s clear now. Thanks a lot.
So what do you do when you want to revert to the default settings of the bash_profile or to the default bash_profile?

This is why you generally should make back up versions before editing config files.

Great! So How do you make a backup of your bash_profile so that you can revert to it whenever you want to?

you should know how to make backup of files? The better question is: what is good practice? You could name the file bash_profile.back for example
or if you want to keep multiple backups, copy the files and when pasting, add a date or date time at the end of the file name

Whether or not a slash is important and what it does depends on exactly what command you’re using so if you’re doing something you’re not sure about it’s always best to check the manual. For the given example it would make a difference as without the forward slash should that directory not already exist you’d end up creating a new file named historical without error. Probably best to add the slash if you’re intending to copy it to a directory so at least it’ll warn you if you mistype the name.

The Baseball folder is what I use for my personal projects (I’m learning code to do baseball analytics/sabermetrics type things) and codecademy is my folder for all my codecademy curriculum projects. In the script, it takes an input of whether it’s baseball or codecademy, afterwards it asks for the project name, for this you would put in the name of the folder for said project. For example, in the Data Science path, there is a project called Reggie’s Linear Regression, and I have a folder called reggie with all the files for that project and it’s own python venv (so as not to add dependencies on the original python instance). Attached is a txt file of the bash script
Ideally, I will run the script, and I type in that it’s for codecademy, and the project folder’s name is reggie. But I get that far and the directory doesn’t seem to change because it returns “venv/bin/activate: no such file or directory” am I calling the variable in. the wrong way for the file path?

24,Command Line SQLite - errors,"Get Help,Command Line","general,navigating-file-system",3,"

Hi,
I am trying to use SQLite, I think i have downloaded it onto my computer because i can find it by going through each file using cd, however when I try to use the commands that are suggested on https://www.codecademy.com/paths/data-science/tracks/analyze-data-sql-go-off-platform/modules/analyze-data-sql-learn-off-platform/articles/what-is-sqlite I get either “unexpected EOF when looking for matching” and “unexpected end of file”. I tried to then use the other command to refresh and it just said command not found.
As you can probably tell, I am a complete novice, so any help is appreciated to allow me to get past this part!
Thank you.

Hey there! Welcome to the forums 
As you can see, it’s outputting this message to you:

error: cannot start sqlite3: Not found in PATH

Which is basically telling you that you need to add sqlite3 as a new environment variable in your computer in order to be able to execute it. You basically always have to do that whenever you install something you wanna use in the command line. Now, I would post screenshots of the process but my computer is in Spanish…does that bother you or should I post them?

@net0433359574,
When using the command line you have to make sure you pay very close attention to what you are typing.  If you have even one character wrong, things won’t work as you expect them to.  Let me try to break it down for you so you understand why it didn’t work at each step.
Looking at your first command, you tried to run a file that doesn’t exist:

Instead, it should have been  winpty ./sqlite3.exe since the file is called sqlite3 and not sqlite.
In the next two commands, you don’t add the file type at the end of the filename.
image718×168 49.5 KB
When you do this, bash will assume these are aliases.  You can use aliases, but before you can you have to set those aliases up in your path, as @yizuhi mentioned.
Your ls command worked perfectly and showed you the contents of the directory, so no problems there.  However, you then tried to use the cd command to opensqlite3.exe:
image716×165 48.2 KB
The cd command stands for “change directory” and can only be used on directories (folders), which is why you received an error telling you that sqlite3.exe is not a directory.
So, moving forward, if you want to open the file you will use the winpty ./sqlite3.exe.
If you want to set up an alias so you can open it from anywhere on your computer by using the sqlite3 command, then follow the Codecademy instructions at the link you provided, but you will want to put single quotes around ${PWD} since the path to that file has spaces in it:
echo ""alias sqlite3=\""winpty '${PWD}'/sqlite3.exe\"""" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
Hope this helps clear some things up.  Happy coding!

25,Layout problem when redirecting output to file using command prompt,"Get Help,Command Line",bash-scripting,6,"
When I’m using the command prompt of Git Bash and enter a command (e.g. ‘ls’), the output is okay (every filename is displayed on a separate line).
But when I redirect the output to a file (e.g. 'ls > OUT.txt`) and open it with Notepad, the entire output is displayed on 1 line only (line break/end of line is missing).
How can I redirect the output from the command prompt window to a file with every filename displayed on a separate line when opening it with Notepad?
","
Are you sure that is notepad specific problem?
what if you did:
cat OUT.txt

do you also get all the output on one line?

It’s not a Notepad specific problem, using other editors have the same problem.
When using 'cat OUT.txt the output is okay, which means that every filename is displayed on a separate line. I think this is because the output is displayed in the command prompt window. But when I try to redirect this output using 'cat OUT.txt > OUT2.txt, then opening OUT2.txt with Notepad has the same problem.
I think that somehow there’s a problem with recognizing the EOL characters when writing the output to a file.

here is a possible explanation:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/426397/do-line-endings-differ-between-windows-and-linux
different in new line characters between the different operating systems.

I think the different line endings between Unix/Linux and Windows explains the problem.
But is there also a solution to get my output written to a Windows .txt file correctly?

Honestly? No idea. You would have to do some research into this matter

I assume the lessons are based on bash? Bash is still a good shout if for no other reason that’s it’s so popular and therefore has more guidance and better libraries and such available. There’s a few online guides to enable a built-in bash shell on windows-10 which is relatively straightforward. I think that should be enough for most of the lessons.
I’ve never been a big fan of cmd and had little to no use of powershell so perhaps someone can advocate for them but I don’t think you’ll regret learning bash commands.

Hello,
I use git bash on my pc. You can download it here: https://gitforwindows.org/. I guess it’s important to learn it since git is essential to a developer. If you use VS code you can also run the integrated terminal.
I’m also doing the web dev path. I’m currently on chapter 5. JavaScript: Arrays, Loops, and Objects. It would be nice to help each other out 




 ajax0717771947:

Im following the web development course. Could really do with some advice on what to do here. There is no mention in the course what to do if you are on windows.


The emulated terminal in the lessons and projects is simulating bash.
Windows has it’s own command shell (cmd), which has some commands in common with Windows.
For example cd .. will take you to the parent directory on either cmd or bash; mkdir works on both, as does pwd. touch, however, does not exist in Windows by default.
To the best of my knowledge (and I’m open to correction, if wrong) the command line lesson in the web dev path can be done without having to install bash on Windows. A fair amount of what it will teach you can be applied to the Windows CLI (cmd), though some individual commands won’t work (as per my touch example).
I wouldn’t recommend installing Git Bash just for the sake of that lesson, though. (Or at all, really… Git is perfectly usable from the Windows CLI, and trying to wrangle both Git - which you may be unfamiliar with - alongside bash - which you’re unfamiliar with - seems like a recipe for confusion.)

Thanks for all the responses  and advice.  The course ends up using git bash.  It just doesn’t let you know that until a few lessons in.  So it turns out I can just follow along with the course without issue/decisions.

Im also on chapter 5.  Just jumped ahead to take cmd line and git sections to change it up.  Ill return to 5 shortly and be back to following in order.   Message anytime to chat the course

@jimmywijaya,
You were right to change the numbers to reflect the version you downloaded.
You are probably getting this error because you didn’t put a space between cd and the tilde ~.
However, just in case, make sure you have unzipped the folder and make sure your path is correct.

Hi @el_cocodrilo
Thanks for your reply. I have unzipped the folder and also, tried both with space and without space between cd and the tilde ~ but it still won’t work.
I managed to to get to the outcome by moving through the filesystem one by one using the cd command (this is quite exhausting).  But I am still curious what went wrong with the first attempt I made.
Kind Regards,
Jimmy

Question 25 wants us to remove the “dough” directory. Can someone explain why ‘rm -rf dough’ is the answer, instead of ‘rm -r dough’? I used ‘rm -r dough’ and it worked but this f is throwing me off. Thank you!
","
I’ve not seen this lesson before but the -f flag is to force removal which ignores nonexistent files/directories (no warnings), ignores write protection (on files but not directories) and removes the warning prompt. If you’re confident about the contents you’re trying to delete then it can make removal much less hassle.

Hi @blog3542724870: -r does the specified action recursively. This means if it is specified on a folder, it will go through all the folders and try to delete them, which may not be always successful in deleting all the files. If you use -r with -f, basically you are going through all folders and forcefully removing them permanently.
Hope this helps!

Hi Paul,
Right now, you are echoing an array, i.e. a “list” that contains the contents of the first line. What you want to do is to get the version number from index 1 in the array, as specified in step 5, i.e. you need to add the intermediate step
version=${splitfirstline[1]}

Zip the resulting  /build directory.

Thank you, midlindner!
Although we’ve now managed to create our file build.zip;
however the progress was printing (stored 0%) and (deflated 10%), which does not look right?
Please see a screenshot below:


I found this:

When zip add a file, it will compress it if it makes sense.
If the file is big enough, zip will use the compression algorithm  DEFLATE  (and print “deflated” and the % gained with the compression).
For very small files the compression will make the result bigger (for example, if I manually deflate a file with 2 bytes, I will get 4 bytes) so zip decides to STORE them (no compression) : it prints “stored” and 0% because this “compression” didn’t change the size. zip will also STORE folders (no content).
You can easily play with the compression : zip -0 will STORE everything, zip -1 to zip -9 will change the compression level of DEFLATE and zip -Z bzip2 will change the compression method.
So, to answer to your question : the stored 0% is fine ! The file has been added but not compressed.

here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23484386/zip-stored-0-should-i-be-concerned
Most of those files are empty, so they don’t get compressed. To see if zip worked properly, you can hover over the “build” folder, click on the 3 dots, and delete the folder. Then in the bash console type:
$ unzip build.zip. This will unzip the zipped file into a new “build” folder. Compare the files to the files in your “source” folder, and you’ll see they are the same.

Thank you very much!
I just followed your delete/unzip idea, and it worked great!

Everything seems perfectly fine but after I run the zip command it always says "" bash: zip: command not found""

Yes, which is why commands like mv have an -i option, and some people even alias mv to always be interactive.
Working in the command line gives power, but with power comes responsibility. So you need to make backups, or revision with version control software like git

So either you specified the wrong location or never created such a file. Also keep in mind that files don’t exist in a single global directory so if you created a file in one directory and then look for it somewhere else, you won’t find it.

I can’t figure out the solution to this step, why do we have to use $ in firstline=$(head -n 1 source/changelog.md). The dollar sign is used to access the variable but here we are extracting first line of changelog.md file.

Hi vashu1229,
The $(…) syntax is called command substitution. It basically lets bash perform the command contained in the $(…) separately, and replaces the $(…) with the result of the command, i.e. in this case, the string of the first line of the file.
Here’s some more information if you are interested:
https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Command-Substitution.html
All the best,

Hi @mtf, thanks for looping me in. I’ll admit that I’m not familiar with this topic but let’s see what we can do 
I read through the threads linked and on my end, I was able to work through the exercise without a problem.

@dev3464546822,  could you provide your code? Perhaps it’s related to the browser version? If you give me a timeframe of when your error occurred I can maybe even check against any active site maintenance.

Hi Kenny -
This link helped me resolve it.
I ended up using a combination of these two commands over the next few exercises… I had to run the sed command every time I saved modifications to the script, as it would add in these ‘line endings’.
Using  sed  Command
Remove the spurious CR characters. You can do it with the following command:
sed -i -e 's/\r$//' NAME-OF-FILE.sh

and then:
Run the following command,
:set ff=unix

to convert the formatting to unix.
I think there was an issue where there was some sort of windows ‘line endings’ instead of unix.

i also have had this problem with this exercise. The problem with mine is that it is confusing as to which terminal to enter the commands. The first step checks as done when entering the #!/bin/bash into the bash script on the right but on your screenshot above you have entered everything on the left script.sh terminal. Then no matter where i enter the echo command the second task does not check as done. It is just all very confusing and even after entering the solution it is still not at all informative. can you help?

Hi @cmorritt1984!
I see your confusion and it seems like we should clear up which part is the code editor and which part is the terminal.
The code editor is the middle section on this webpage : 
image1920×932 117 KB

In this case, it has a file opened, called script.sh.  Upon opening the exercise, it should look like: . It has the name of the file up top and then below you see a 1 which denotes the line number. As you add more code to this file, you’ll also see more numbers.
The terminal is the section to the right of the code editor and looks like:

We’ve changed some of the checkpoint’s wording to be more clear and direct about which section is what.
I hope that helps

49,Off-platform help needed with basic use of Terminal to open database using SQlite,"Get Help,Command Line",general,15,"
I’m a total beginner to using terminals/command lines. I’m doing the data science stream and got up to the off-platform SQL lesson.
I downloaded SQLite, the sample database and Git Bash as instructed. I then tried to follow the video on ‘go-off platform for working with SQLite’, ‘Setting up SQLite Locally’ :
https://www.codecademy.com/paths/data-science/tracks/analyze-data-sql-go-off-platform/modules/analyze-data-sql-learn-off-platform/articles/what-is-sqlite
I am completely stuck at the point in the video where he uses the terminal to open the example database using SQlite.exe. In the video he is using cmdr and inputs ./sqlite.exe/FILENAME to get the database to open. I can only get as far as the ‘ls’ step using Git Bash. 
","
Hello @elviramanjaji4572717, welcome to the forums. Could you post your command line code please.

I just tried to copy what the instructor did exactly (./sqlite.exe/FILENAME into the terminal) and nothing happened. I don’t know if that clarifies? I’m a real beginner. Beyond doing the basic command line lesson I really don’t know much.

What is the name of the file? Did you put that instead of FILENAME?

Yes. The name of the file is acs-1-year-2015.sqlite.
It is the exact same name the instructor used. So I typed
./sqlite.exe/acs-1-year-2015.sqlite (like the instructor) and nothing happened.

@elviramanjaji4572717,
Make sure that the file (acs-1-year-2015.sqlite) and the executable (sqlite3.exe) are both in the same folder, and make sure you’ve opened your terminal to that folder.  Then make sure you type the exact command he did: ./sqlite3.exe acs-1-year-2015.sqlite
In the command you posted here, you left out the 3 in sqlite3 and you put a forward slash instead of a space:



 elviramanjaji4572717:

So I typed
./sqlite.exe/acs-1-year-2015.sqlite (like the instructor) and nothing happened.



Thanks for your patience! Sorry - my OP just had typos. I definitely put in:
./ sqlite3.exe acs-1-year-2015.sqlite
Once I put that in it just says ‘it is a directory’'but nothing further happens!

No worries.  Without seeing your computer it’s hard to diagnose the problem.  If you post a screenshot, I’d be able to help a lot more.
Did you already run through the instructions on the link you posted for setting up the sqlite3 alias in Git Bash, or did you just skip to the video?  I only ask because if you did, there’s no reason to open the file the way he does in the video.

I go to the file and hit ‘Git bash here’  - that opens the file and then I hit ls - which shows the correct files in the directory. It’s just that next step. I do wonder if I haven’t downloaded/installed something correctly. It’s OK - I’m planning to keep going through the lessons and then maybe get a tutor for an hour or so for the off-platform stuff.

Try these two things before considering paying for a tutor:

Type winpty ./sqlite3.exe acs-1-year-2015.sqlite and see if that works.

If that doesn’t work try this:

Type winpty ./sqlite3.exe and see if that opens up SQLite.  If it does, just use the command .open acs-1-year-2015.sqlite and it will open your database.


Really annoying but that still doesn’t work. Never mind - you tried. I’m sure it’s something really stupid that I’ve done.

Alright.  Well if you don’t want to use the command line, then feel free to use a GUI application like DB Browser.  It’s a lot better for exploring a database, and you can still type your own SQL queries in so you don’t have to use the point and click method if you don’t want to.

Oh wow! Thanks - I’ll have a look. Very helpful!

Thank you so much - I just downloaded the browser and I think this is what I should look at initially. It is perfect.

No problem.
Understanding how to use SQLite on the command line is useful — and it is necessary for when you want to incorporate it into your apps/programs — but for exploring/interacting with data I think options like DB Browser are better.
Enjoy and happy coding!

“Text files created on DOS/Windows machines have different line endings than files created on Unix/Linux. DOS uses carriage return and line feed (”\r\n"") as a line ending, which Unix uses just line feed (""\n""). You need to be careful about transferring files between Windows machines and Unix machines to make sure the line endings are translated properly."" (http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~krueger/csc209h/tut/line-endings.html)
It seems that solution to this is:
sed -i -e 's/\r$//' create_mgw_3shelf_6xIPNI1P.sh

52,Do files have a standard output?,"Get Help,Command Line",redirecting-input-output,1,"
So I’m currently on the “Ecosystem” project ( https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-the-command-line/projects/ecosystem ). And in Task 8  I’m supposed to do the following:

In one command, pipe the standard output of the ls -la command to the head command, then append the standard output to ** list1.txt**, then pipe the standard output to the wc command.
Once you complete the above step, use cat to view the contents of list1.txt .

Apparently, the correct way to do it is this : ls -la | head >> list1.txt | wc
Here’s what the glossary of commonly used commands ( https://www.codecademy.com/articles/command-line-commands ) says about pipes:

The | takes the standard output of the command on the left, and pipes it as standard input to the command on the right. You can think of this as “command to command” redirection.

And the example it gives is exactly what I wanted to use in Task 8: cat volcanoes.txt | wc
So why is it suggested that I pipe the standard output from list1.txt to wc? I though that only commands can produce a standard output. Shouldn’t I use cat on list1.txt and then pipe its output to wc?

54,Use of 'Command Prompt / Terminal' on Codeacademy,"Get Help,Command Line",general,4,"
Hello –
Working with Windows and installed Git Bash as well as Miniconda as per Codeacademy modules.
I am confused as to when to use  Windows Terminal vs. Git Bash vs. Miniconda in practice and how Codeacademy refers to one vs. the other? For example: in Tutorial (https://www.codecademy.com/articles/install-python3)  on setting up Python 3 reference is made to ‘command prompt’ – is this terminal, git bash or miniconda and how can I tell going forward for other instances where term ‘command prompt’ is used?
","
Welcome to the forums @geckoded
I believe it is referring to the Python command line, which should have a sepperate app on your computer desktop. It can also be accessed through the terminal, usually by typing ‘python’ or ‘ppython’

@geckoded,
If you are using Windows, Miniconda will be automatically set up in Command Prompt (Cmd) when you install it.
So in short:

use Command Prompt for Conda and Python
use Git Bash for practicing your command line and Git skills

If you really love Bash rather than the Windows command line, you could download Python by itself and add it to your Git Bash path.  You could probably also do this with Miniconda (haven’t tried it myself), but since it is already on Cmd it is easier to just use it there.

Thank you both @8-bitgaming and @el_cocodrilo – this clarified it!

I went down this rabbit hole recently.
Codecademy has a shell profile set up guide in tips and resources Setting Up Your Command Line with a video by Farish @71kash  (which hopefully you encountered before the pipenv review). Their lesson supplement is specifically a bash set up because the lessons are in bash, which can only help you so far if you’re eager to run a thorough shell set up on zsh with efficient control of file system navigation and clean pip/env/version functionality.
Here are some external resources that helped me:


Scripting OS X - Moving to zsh (with  this presentation) by Apple’s Armin Briegel who also wrote this book.


How to set up virtual environments for Python on a Mac by Matthew Broberg (Still bash but you get his procedural idea and more complex pip/env configurations)


Mac Setup iTerm zsh via Sourabh Bajaj (Full on, depending on how far you want to go re command line)


Setting up Python (including pip) on macOS with pyenv, virtualenv and zsh. by Mohamed Jameel (a more basic yet similar track/configuration to Broberg’s)


Good to note that these are more or less approaches to the same thing – pip/env configs with zsh setup.
I think, for Mac users, Briegel’s blog and book really help explain what running chsh -s /bin/zsh does  to your machine in order to then inform how you wish to shell script on a 2020 Mac/Terminal in general.

Also, with the release of Catalina, zsh is the default.   If you have updated it might break things.   Your bash shell might be recoverable with chsh -s /bin/bash .  Overall, the commands are the same, you gain some additional features with zsh.  I have seen some problems with the terminal though after a Catalina update.

Hi there!



 marcusde36ste:

The lessons will most likely tell you which one you’ll need to use.



 marcusde36ste:

the commands i’ve learned don’t work in miniconda but i also can’t open Python files in git bash.


This is because the “Learn the Command Line” course isn’t teaching you commands for working with Miniconda, and because Git Bash isn’t a utility for working with Python files. It’s a bit like saying you can’t open a Word document with MS Paint; the command line interface, whether that’s Git Bash or using conda, is designed for certain tasks and will only understand input that it was designed to accommodate. 

Thanks a lot! I’m starting to understand it.
so does the command line interface of Anaconda serve another purpose than that of Git Bash?

I think Windows is the odd one out when it comes to directory paths.
On Windows, you’d write a path like C:\some folder\a file.txt.
On Linux, Unix etc… paths are written /usr/bin/home/a file.txt.
The forward slash convention in Bash likely comes from it’s origins on *nix systems.

Hi @remogirard7746549799,
In your home directory, there’s a file called .profile (on Mac) or .bash_profile / .bashrc (on Linux). Open that file in a text editor and add a line at the bottom with what you want your prompt to be. For example, if you want a minimal prompt:
PS1=""$ "" 

Here’s my prompt, by the way. It shows the current time, then my username, then which directory I’m in, and then the standard dollar sign prompt (items like \033 just sets the color so the prompt isn’t all white text).
\[\e]0;\u@\h: \w\a\][$(date +%H:%M)] ${debian_chroot:+($demian_chroot)}\[\033[01;32m\]\u\[\033[00m\]:\[\033[01;34m\]\w\[\033[00m\]\$

Hi zystvan,
thank you very much for your reply. I tried it with both files.
nano ~/.bash_profile

nano ~/.profile

@remogirard7746549799 I don’t have a Mac to test with unfortunately, but I found this article which says Macs are no longer using the Bash shell which may be why it didn’t work. Try doing the same thing as before, but this time editing ~/.zshrc (same purpose as the other files, just for the zsh shell).

super weird. Are you using cygwin? If using windows 10, i would recommend using WLS (windows linux subsystem)
Haven’t used cygwin in ages? Can i see the output of the following commands:
pwd

using ./ will execute from current directory, not PATH.
You could navigate to the bin directory:
cd ~/bin

then try:

Hey, welcome to the forums!
The issue is with your for loop… which you’re only using to print out the filenames to the terminal.
By the time you get to your if statement, to make sure we don’t copy our secretinfo.md file, your loop has finished and $filename is fixed at it’s final value of source/secretinfo.md.
So, your script is only trying to move one file - and it’s the one you’re explicitly telling it to ignore.
Can you see how you need to change your script to fix this? 

Okay so are the instructions for the build a build script wrong? I am following it exactly as they stated. Is the issue that my for loop should be after the if statement with the $filename?

Thank you your clue was good enough. I didn’t have my if statement in the right for loop.
#!/bin/bash

echo ""What is your name?""
read name

When learning about the wc command, it was shown to us as

$ cat filename.txt | wc

but in the Ecosystem project it asks us to redirect a file as the standard input to the wc command.  So we wrote

$ wc -l < filename.txt

Without the -l  option, it seems that both the pipe and the standard input redirect do the same exact thing.  Is there a reason for doing one instead of another?
I know that I can use the code

$ cat filename.txt | wc | cat > filename2.txt

to copy the word count to filename2.  Would the following code do the same thing?

$ wc < filename.txt | cat > filename2.txt

in the first you sort the content of the lakes.txt, in the second code sample you pipe the standard output of the file to sort
this enables us to for example do a grep first:
cat lakes.txt | grep lake | sort

so sort anything with lake in the name.

thanks. I get your explanation but still it does not really make sense to me.
wouldn’t your code be the same as:
sort lakes.txt | grep lake

?

the output, maybe, yes. But now we first have to sort everything, and then pipe that output to grep and grep the entries we want. Sound less efficient. Sorting is generally an expensive operation.
also, it will happen that you might have 5 pipes, or a file with 100,000 lines
the big problem is that these “commands” are entire programs written in the C language. Due to this abstraction, it might be difficult to “see” the difference.

Here’s how I would try to phrase its first bit in an English sentence:

if “mkdir” is contained in the string “ls|rm”, do the following: mdkir myscript.sh

This would create a directory named myscript at the current location.
I’m just afraid I’m reading this all wrong:

Maybe I don’t understand what case does, I think its similar to an if in a program
I don’t understand the ls|rm syntax. Are these the options for the case-branching

Somtimes the $ variables are in double quotes (""$1""), sometimes they’re not ($1), I don’t get why.

Granted, my code is currently mysteriously broken, but shouldn’t the if-then loop that copies/doesn’t copy be in the “do” within the for loop, not after the “done?” I think your code has the “not copying” simply because secretinfo is the last filename to be assigned to $filename

My code runs now, so I have “control” code, and indeed, I’d move the if/then set into the “do” portion if you’re still at work!

That comes from examining why you would be able to.
Why would you?
If you have an executable file, then you can execute it by typing its file path in a terminal.
There also exists a variable $PATH listing directories that will be searched if you only type a base name for a file
So where did you put it? That’d be something you’d tell by considering how you installed it, that’s the action that placed the file somewhere, right. You could also search your file system for a file of that name.
Some python modules are also executable, so if you installed it in such a way that python can import it, then you can also tell python to run the module.

80,How do I make use of a command that removes raster images from a PDF,"Get Help,Command Line",bash-scripting,7,"

sed-4.7-x64.exe -i ""/<defs>/,/<\/defs>/d"" MadinaMushaf_compressed.pdf


But the thing is, I don’t know what to do with this code. Where do I put it? Do I need to download any application before using it? I have Windows 10 and Windows 7.
“MadinaMushaf_compressed.pdf” is the name of the PDF that I want to remove the raster image from.
","
Hi @kutada
Based on what’s coming after it, sed-4.7-x64.exe is referring to GNU sed. If you’re on Linux, you might already have it installed. If you’re not on Linux, you may need to install it before hand.
As to whether running sed with those options will do what you want, I couldn’t say. 

I downloaded GNU and I got this:
 ![sedtt|606x256]
So what should I do with it now?

If you have windows 10, i recommend WSL (windows subsystem for Linux), which is officially supported by Microsoft.
the latest update of GnuWin32 was in 2010, in software years, that is old.
i also recommend investing time in understanding what Linux and WSL are, and what the difference is.

the thing is - I only need it to remove the raster images in this pdf,, and I will probably not use sed again

Then you should look into a windows tool perhaps? Then you make life easier for yourself.




 stetim94:

windows tool


every time there’s I have a problem to solve on windows and I google for a solution, there’s never something saying what needs to be done instead there’ll be an executable complete with GUI for the tiniest tasks like syncing the clock on boot
makes me look around for someone to blame for the situation, clearly someone needs to get shot
@kutada there’s probably a file in your bin directory named sed or sed.exe, that’s what you would run, with those arguments. but since you’re running something that you … well, don’t even know how to run, don’t be too surprised if it doesn’t do anything resembling what you want
For example, it would not correctly deal with:
<svg>
<defs>
</defs></svg>

It would leave the opening svg tag but not the closing one.
It would match on <defs> but not on <defs > so that would lead to skipping or if it’s the closing one that doesn’t match exactly then everything gets deleted from that point because the closing tag is never found
There may be 600 pages, but there might not be all that many defs tags. You’d want to inspect it anyway to figure out what you’re doing so grab a text editor.

","
Hi @kearkelk
I’m struggling to understand what you’re doing, tbh.
If you’re working through the Codecademy C++ material, “compile” and “execute” are two different actions in the learning environment. You compile with g++ my_code.cpp and execute it with ./a.out for example.
These would already be two separate commands* to the terminal, so it would (assuming no errors) look like:
$ g++ my_code.cpp
$ ./a.out
some output from your code is here!
$

If that’s not what you’re talking about, then I’m genuinely confused. Unless you can elaborate a bit more about what you’re doing and how, with a screenshot maybe, I’m lost. 
* Unless you’re familiar enough with bash to know you could do $ g++ my_code.cpp; ./a.out for the same result.

Sorry for not being clear enough, I know what the commands are, and how execute and compile work, it’s just that I need to go down a line in the bash terminal and I don’t know how.

Go down? Start a new line? Should the program do that, or you?
When does a terminal display a new line? It’s not an action to be carried out, it’s a character in the output stream, so if your program should terminate a line, then it would need to write a line termination character.
Might make more sense if you don’t think of your program as having control over your terminal, instead it simply writes characters that you can direct into a file or into a terminal application or a network connection or be ignored altogether.

DOS is a bit of a relic. It can do very little compared to e.g bash and it is very rigid. The user base for DOS and actual developers writing scripts for DOS is very small compared to anything else. I’m not 100% sure but it seems that the programming language for windows with more functionality would be powershell based on Microsofts .NET.
EDIT: It turns out that FreeDOS as an operating system(!!!)  is still somewhat popular among a small number of scientific researchers. It allows them to build monolithic programs that use all the resources of the computer, for the OS is so lightweight and “so close to the hardware”.
EDIT2: Yeah I’m on Windows too, partially so that I don’t have to do everything through the CMD  . When I needed the command line I used mainly PowerShell, for it has some extra functionality useful for networking and socket control. Even then the syntax turned out terribly difficult, long and unintuitive, on top of that the learning resources are limited  - mainly Microsoft docs, Q&A and forums. That’s why I’ve done this only as fun project, it took me four days of study and research of syntax and libraries to achieve what I wanted to do - a port scanner that checks website if it runs mail server as well as asks its DNS for MX entries, then checks if the returned servers are secured (TSL) , then it acts like a mail server trying to send an email to relay and to see if the configuration of the server allows for relaying email - all this in powershell… PAIN.
Then when I was done, I thought I wonder how hard it would be to achieve in Python?
To my surprise available packages done half of the coding for me - I didn’t have to manually create a socket, then give it the details, then attempt to connect, nor create buffer byte array to hold anticipated response… No it was just one imported object class that could take the IP and perform all the operations through its methods. The code was clean and readable and ready in less than a day. And at the time I was only about half-way done with the Python3 course (but I used google a bunch of times  )
So yeah, my suggestion would be don’t get too involved with DOS unless you fall in the research scientist minority. Learn a real programming language and you will be able to do so much more and so much quicker. The power of a programming/scripting language is in its community - the more people work on (and with) it the more built-in functionality and supported extensions you can find, the better it is optimized to run across different platforms and generally.the more you can achieve with it. And only so often you will want to reinvent a wheel since there are so many incredible wheels already available for you to spin.

I’m a Windows user too, and I’ve learned that just about everything in web dev is harder in Windows (not limited to codecademy).
I’ve found that just about everything codecademy teaches on here is possible on Windows if you install Git Bash.  Here’s one place you can download it.
https://gitforwindows.org/
Once you install Git Bash, you can execute commands “just like everyone else” using a Mac or Linux-based system.  The main difference is when you have to install or do things using “sudo”; that doesn’t work on Windows, even in Git Bash, but researching the Windows system alternatives is a learning experience in itself.

That’s because most of basic bash functionality is already available in DOS with slightly different names. Git Bash provides a translator, but nothing more.
A good option for learning would be to sign up a Google Cloud Computing account, they give 1 year, 300usd for free, so you can have your own virtual computer on the cloud and use Google Chrome Remote Destop to connect to it. You can run a variety of distributions and if you don’t go for some ridiculous tier (cause you can get even 128CPU and 20GPU or whatever) then the money they give you should last for all the trial period.

The command line is built into all operating systems and functions slightly differently on each, though they all do roughly similar things.
Codecademy teaches the Linux command line which MacOS shares a lot (if not all) in common with.
Windows’ version is Command Prompt and this has  commands that do the same thing.  A Linux-like alternative for Windows that I use is called CygWin and can be downloaded here. CygWin uses the commands you’re learning on Codecademy, while the Command Prompt does not.  MacOS and Linux’s command lines do.

Thanks,

There is no << as i know. < works like a function. It makes gymnastics.txt to use itself as cat gymnastics.txt.
so if you type: “cat < gymnastics.txt” (then press enter) then you type: gymnastics.txt it will output the gymnastics file. But then again I’m no such a bash wizard

I figured I’d go through the Command Line training and see if I could learn anything knew. I use bash on a daily basis so I’m no novice. I’ve never heard of anyone using “cat < lakes.txt”. When I saw that I was confused. “cat lakes.txt” and “cat < lakes.txt” give the same output. I’m guessing it’s in there for some reason that I may run into later. But as far as I know the “<” is completely extraneous and not necessary.
You should be fine not using it. “cat lakes.txt” works just fine.
If I have some epiphany later I’ll edit my post.

I came to the forum to ask about the ‘<’ as well. Could not see how it was different than just using whatever command you want on the file or directory. Thank you for confirming that it is (at least it seems) extraneous in most cases.

Hello there!
in the Command Line project Build a Build Script
https://gist.github.com/b8c5103c1efbf333bad85ae74dae8e66
I’ve run onto misunderstanding over how the command ‘cp’ on ‘filename’ does actually work.
While iterating filenames in directory ‘source’ the command ‘echo “Not copying” $filename’ (line 17)’ then just informed user, by only printing in terminal, that the file ‘source/secretinfo.md’ conditionally (line 14) won’t be copied to the ‘build’ directory.
The command ‘echo’, as i grasp it, is actually using just for printing purpose in terminal, so how the command ‘cp $filename’ (line 21) does work and why actually exclude the file ‘source/secretinfo.md’ from a list of iterated files in this regard, since there any other actions on that loop are predefined?
Thanks!
","
Same puzzle! Hope someone can pop over to this post and help answer!

In the exercise you refer to, the aim is to create a bash script that selectively copies files from one folder (named source) to another folder (named build). In the specific case of the exercise, the idea is to exclude one special file (named secretinfo.md) from being copied.
To that end, we


loop over all files in the source folder using
for filename in source/* do


we check for each file whether it is secretinfo.md using
if [ $filename == ""source/secretinfo.md"" ]


we decide what to do when the file is secretinfo.md after
then


we decide what to do when the file is not secretinfo.md after
else


After points 3 and 4 you can put any code you want. You can use echo to inform the user if the file that is currently handled is secretinfo.md. You can also decide to put in the cp command. The echo and cp commands are in principle independent – the one command does not know about the other. So, what you do in the exercise is: you use echo to inform the bash script user about what is going to happen (namely, a file will be copied or not) and after that you take the corresponding copy action (or not). Does that clarify the situation?
Note that in a real-life situation, you may, of course, decide to ignore more files than just one when copying from a source to a build folder. The exercise just shows how you could in principle go about making a build script.
P.S. It would help if you indented your bash script a bit more consistently, so you can see which ifs, elses, fis, etc. belong together.

Welcome to the forum!



 bboycpu:

if [""$filename"" == “source/secretinfo.md”] then


In the line above, then needs to be on the next line like you have it here:

88,Use of the LESS environment variable?,"Get Help,Command Line",,1,"
In step 9 of the Lingua Franca project, we learn that the less command can be configured through the LESS environment variable. It seems that by setting this environment variable, an option of choice is passed to less automatically every time we call it.


As we also learned to create aliases for commands, I wonder what is the use of setting the LESS environment variable instead of just creating an alias like lesn=""less -N""?


Are there any other commands that can be configured in a similar way using (corresponding) environment variables?

89,'Permission denied' when moving sqlite3 on Mac,"Get Help,Command Line",,10,"
Hi all,
I wanted to use SQLite on my Mac as described here under the following link:
https://www.codecademy.com/paths/data-science/tracks/analyze-data-sql-go-off-platform/modules/analyze-data-sql-learn-off-platform/articles/what-is-sqlite
Under the description Mac OS X, I am struggling with step 3 of the list: Moving the sqlite3 file to /usr/local/bin/.
In the Terminal, the message ‘Permission denied’ is returned.
Anybody knows what I can do? (I am a beginner using the command line).
Kind regards
","
you can start by checking the permission of the directory:
ls -l path

with the right path of course, then if needs be, give yourself additional privileges.

Uh. Arguably you shouldn’t be trying to put it there in the first place.
Put it in ~/bin and make sure ~/bin is in your $PATH, some os’s add ~/bin to $PATH for you, otherwise do it yourself.
Or don’t move it anywhere and run it from where you already have it

I will try it…
Thank you

Why does the text on the page say to put it there in the first place?

I’d have to guess but maybe something like “oh look there are executables here let’s put our program here too”
But the sqlite you are installing isn’t a system component, it doesn’t belong there, it’s more of a user script and so it belongs in the users set of programs. Idk abouc mac but linux distros also have directories /usr/local/{bin,etc,share,lib,include,man} and /opt for the purpose of non-system-owned system-wide installations where things can be placed without interference in either direction. It’s a personal executable, so, ~/bin is where I think it belongs.

Hey! Had same issue, just done it manually via finder. Worked for me! Good luck!
P.S. I guess that it is some kind of Mac Security rule for later versions of OS.

Almost any multi-user os denies write permission to system-owned directories

Thanks to all! Tried it out manually and it is working now.
Kind regards!

If anybody else comes across this thread and is struggling to get SQLite up and running, use the command sudo mv sqlite3 /usr/local/bin/ to bypass the permissions problem.

100,Bash Scripting: Build a Build Script,"Get Help,Command Line",,3,"
In task four of this project I do not understand why there isn’t a ‘$’ used to access ‘splitfirstline’. Is there a particular reason for this?
read -a splitfirstline <<< $firstline

Also it is never discussed in the course what a “markdown” is, or what the >>> operator does.
","
The <<< is used with text strings. It can send a string to a command.
command <<< string
In this case the string stored at $firstline is being sent to the command read -a splitfirstline, which reads the string into an array.  splitfirstline is the name of an array that is being created. It’s  an argument for -a so it’s not a variable in this case and doesn’t require a $.
Markdown is a file format that the file changelog.md uses. Markdown files have a file extension .md and are in  plain text, that can be edited by any text editor. Markdown has its own formatting like **bold text** for bold.
I think the lesson could include info on both these topics.

sed works fine with >, that’s not the problem
when reading and writing to the same resource you need to pay some extra attention to the order that things happen (or better yet, not rely on it happening in any specific order to reduce the chance of there being a mistake)

Hey @discreteloner! In answer to your first question, you aren’t supposed to use chmod +x script.sh, you are supposed to use #!/bin/bash.

I did not use it in the exercise; I saw it mentioned in the explaining part and did not see that line appear anywhere  in the exercise so I got curious of when to use it.



you need chmod to make your script executable, have you learned about file permissions in linux yet? chmod command needs to be run on the file itself, so it shouldn’t be part of the script


separation, if you have dozen script with a lot of lines (maybe even a hundred), you don’t want to stuff all of that in one file. bash profile is useful if you have long one liners you want to alias to shorten them.  even then, i would put the aliases in a separate file, so you keep bash profile for other useful linux configuration.


Both. You can create new script or update an existing one


bash profile is a special file, as explained here. so each time you login into a linux system, .bash_profile is read so its quite useful for login configuration. on the other hand, a script could be fetching background image from national geographic every 15 minutes.


macOs and linux both use POSIX standards, so bash scripts work on most linux distros and macOS. Windows does not support bash (well, there are solutions like WSL), so for scripting on windows you will need powershel. I think this course would be good for you. That course focus more on the questions you have then the codecademy course.



Answer for questions







 stetim94:

I have not learn about file permissions in linux. Even if this is the case, I understand the concept of it from what you said even though I cannot know how to use it.



 stetim94:

a script could be fetching background image from national geographic every 15 minutes.


So, does this mean .bash_profile is used when I want to write shortcuts for my frequently use command, while a script contains code that I can make it do something other than be a shortcuts reference such as use it to fetch something from websites etc.?

I will take a look at it. Thanks. I’ve actually been looking for something similar to this course you suggested except it was not a course – just some articles online or some YouTube videos. By far those I found are not actually help me much – only enough to fix specific cases.

understanding file permission will help. The very brief version is that linux only will execute a script if it has the right execution permission (which is very different from windows .exe concept). By default when creating a file a script does not have execute permission



 discreteloner:

So, does this mean .bash_profile is used when I want to write shortcuts for my frequently use command,


no, .bash_profile is special, this file is read at login, so its more useful for configuration (linux is very configurable). .bashrc is more suitable for putting your aliases.
special files like bash_profile and bash_rc are pre-configured, linux checks if these files exist when certain events are fire (logging in -> bash_profile, launching a terminal -> bashrc). Depending on your linux distro, .bash_profile will probably also read .bashrc

107,Getting Start At Bash Profile,"Get Help,Command Line",,2,"
From the exercise:
(https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-the-command-line/lessons/environment/exercises/bash-profile)
Do I have to create this file using nano text editor or it is just a recommend? If just recommend, then why do you recommend it over other text editors? I mean each text editor have something that is good on it own depends on what we need to do with our code to choose the one that we think most suitable with. Let me narrow my question down a bit. In this case, creating bash_profile, what qualification we are looking for in a particular text editor to use?
Another question regarding bash profile is where should I save this file on my local machine? I mean as newbie, I have so many choices to choose where to save this file. My usual go-to would be My Documents on Windows and Linux or Desktops, but I don’t know how would it effect my code result (if any) when I try to run it such as can’t find directory or can’t open or can’t run, etc?
When I run it, should I run Windows Git Bash / Windows Power Shell as administrator or just a regular user? Why (prefer just a short answer specifically to this case only to avoid too much off topic)?
Does this file has to be named “bash_profile”? I mean can it be something else such as “xyz”? Not that I would call it “xyz” but I am wondering what make this file unique and stand out as a file that contain command line instead of just plain text or another code file? What tell our machine?
","
nano is a command line text-editor which by default is installed in unix and unix based and unix derived systems (like linux and solaris). Given nano is a simple command line editor which is by default installed on *nix systems, its a good choice for a simple edit to bash_profile



 discreteloner:

Another question regarding bash profile is where should I save this file on my local machine?


bash_profile is a special file, which means there is usual a convention. bash_profile is stored directly in the users home directory. bash_profile is something linux specific, so not much use creating a bash_profile if are on windows and have no linux subsystem.



 discreteloner:

When I run it, should I run Windows Git Bash / Windows Power Shell as administrator or just a regular user? Why (prefer just a short answer specifically to this case only to avoid too much off topic)?


regular user as much as possible, only use administrator/root privileges when you need it.



 discreteloner:

Does this file has to be named “bash_profile”?


no, there are linux distros where the file is name .profile for example. But sticking to the naming conventions is easier, it requires less tweaking. Changing the name of bash_profile also means changing the bits that use the bash_profile file.

Are you in the drama directory? Use pwd to show the current directory (if you haven’t used this command, it will show the path, for example: home/user/myName, the current directory’s name is the last directory name after the slash).
If you are in the drama directory but still not working then use ls in the drama and in the biopic directory to see if nothing is missing.
If everything is there then restart the session by clicking the X in the up-left corner of the bash console.
Hope this helps

I am trying to move to the Action directory but having trouble moving over.




 bitcoder28422:

I am trying to move to the Action directory but having trouble moving over.


Do you mean that you can’t navigate to the directory(cd), or you can’t copy the file?
If you have problem with navigating then, check if you are in the satire directory(pwd) and then try to move to the action directory(you could do navigate on your own but if you want to stick to the command written there then do this).
If still can’t, then check if the action directory exists.
If none of them worked or directories are missing then restart the terminal.

If you have problem with copying then do the same things as in my previous reply.
Hope this helps

It’s “Please” not “Plase”

Took some research, but I found this: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/283407/can-sed-save-its-output-to-a-file
sed 's/42/XX/' $singleFile > $singleFile

Change to:
sed -i 's/42/XX/' $singleFile

Read about the -i option in the first solution. Hopefully this will help. It worked for me.

I’m cracking up! hahahaha 

Dude!! It worked! Pretty cool. Thank you for your help.
I knew about -i when we use “grep -i ‘FindWord’ filename.txt” when we need to enable the command to be case insensitive. Never thought it could be use for that case! I think it makes sense? Since we want to find a number “42” and substitute for another word.
Thanks again!!

111,Retore $PATH on Mac?,"Get Help,Command Line",,1,"
It seems that I have changed the $PATH in bash to a dir that isn’t running node.js without permission issues OR running with sudo. After looking into this, I think that when I installed Python it set a new $PATH. Now that the path is pointing to this Python directory, node.js won’t run npm install -g create-react-app without permission issues.
Is there a way for me to restore the $PATH to the default settings on a Mac? Will this run node.js without permission issues? Will it affect how Python will run in BASH? I feel like such a noob, but wanting things to work again so I can continue to improve.
Below are screen shots, one with the $PATH and one with the Node.js install $PATH suggestion.

Hello 



 bluthra:

cat volcanoes.txt | wc | >> islands.txt
ideally it should have added wc of volcanoes to island.txt


You overcomplicated this a bit.
This is output of cat volcanoes.txt | wc:
    17    26    204

and you want to add this output to the end of the file islands.txt. But pipe operator is not needed to do that, just redirect the standard output:
cat volcanoes.txt | wc >> islands.txt


We use pipe in bash to serve output of one process as an input for the second process. >> is just a redirection operator.

https://www.codecademy.com/paths/computer-science/tracks/cspath-development-skills/modules/learn-the-command-line-navigation-u/lessons/navigation/exercises/your-first-command
Hello,
I was about to start the course in the link but then I read it was for unix-based systems, and I’m using Windows. I’m almost completely new, yesterday I completed the last project of ‘‘Introduction to programming’’ within computer science path and wanted to start learning about navigation today, but I saw this unix-based systems thing.
What are your suggestions please? How should I do in order not to finish with confusing the navigation I could learn here with the navigation on Windows?
Thank you very much.
Edit: I took up the course, I will be looking for the commands equivalents for Windows as I go with the course.
","
Once you learn the commands for UNIX, you will forget about windows command line. This was the case with me.
Although, you can look about the corresponding windows commands online which is easy to find. Also, in windows 10 latest version, one can use Windows Subsystem for Linux and use UNIX commands in that. No need to see windows commands then…

In the end I installed Git Bash on my Windows.

114,Clarity in lesson Redirecting Input and Output,"Get Help,Command Line",,3,"
This is in reference to the lesson Redirecting Input and Output.
After completing all the lessons and taking notes, with the notes in front of me I seem to continually run into the same issue so I feel I must not be understanding the lesson.
The ‘echo’ command is only discussed briefly in the leaders to the practical lesson. It is not used in the practical lesson (only cat is used), so I found it difficult to choose the correct responses on the quiz where ‘echo’ is used. My understanding is now that echo references contents of a string and cat references the contents of a file. Is this correct?
In the practical lesson, the command “sort greatest.txt” displays the contents of a file alphabetically. However, the quiz asks for a different string: ‘cat greatest.txt | sort’. This format was not used in the lesson; why does the lesson use the quiz to expose me to a different format?
The “head” (and “tail”) command is used in the practical, but never defined. It confounded me why I would be using this command but then need to look up its definition in a separate platform. Though I understand I must have an appreciation for being exposed to many concepts within the lesson, I also felt there was a certain element of uselessness and distraction to have a command tossed in there that lacked any definition or context.
","
A pipe | reads stdin of the left side and writes to stdout of the right side.
From there you can read the manual pages of those programs to find out where they read/write and whether they might read/write in different places in different situations.
$ man cat
If you read the man page for cat you’ll find its primary purpose and namesake is concatenation. Concatenating a single piece of text is just repeating it, and that is often redundant.
$ echo blueberries | cat | cat | cat | cat | cat
Same for the other commands, read their man pages. It says there how they behave.

Awesome tip! Thanks!
I feel this should be in the lesson

Making the user interface would only take a few days, It depends on how many things you want.
The hardest part would be connecting the mobile phones(if you meant real ones), but withdrawing and depositing money(if not real money) would be easy, because you have to store the account balance and the cash then subtract or add to these values (withdrawing money would be subtracting the wanted amount from the account balance and adding that to the cash)

 lkjhjgj:

There is no bin directory in home(~) and it is in root (/) directory


depending on your linux or macOS installation, the bin directory might not yet exist. You can create it of course



 lkjhjgj:

)Inside the bin folder I am unable to create any file it is not permitted error comes although using su


that is conflicting with point 1 you made. Can you elaborate?
note that the bin directory in your home directory (~/bin) is for the current user.


bin is in root directory and not in home directory
Inside root directory and inside that bin folder I cannot create any script

So did you mean to say that I create bin folder in home directory and write scripts inside it by setting the PATH




 lkjhjgj:

bin is in root directory and not in home directory


adding a bin directory to your home directory allows you to easily run scripts as current user. If the directory doesn’t exist, you should create it:
mkdir $HOME/bin




 lkjhjgj:


Inside root directory and inside that bin folder I cannot create any script



with the right privileges, you certainly can. But why would you?

Okay I got your point, But why I am unable to create a script inside the bin folder of root directory
Although I am super user and use
sudo vi new.sh
It give me error that it is read only and you cannot write when I save :wq

it seems macOS has something called SIP (system intergrity protection), which seems to be the issue you run into:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_Integrity_Protection
i can perfectly place scripts in /bin, but looking at what bin is used for:

That depends on the statistics of your device. The better it is, the better it runs.
Not only that, but it also depends on your internet. The better it is, the— you get it, right?

Well My 1Gbps internet and XPS 15 9560 don’t look fall off from anything. Even with my 8700k and 32gb  desktop as well. Bring me some valid reason, not your useless assumption. You get it, right?

I think we can all agree from that it’s the  reason why you’re experiencing this, right?
1GB of internet seems quite obvious that you’d be having a “laggy command line environment implementation” using Codecademy.

8700k and 32gb desktop


Scratch what I said here:



 _markviii:

Because really, the only thing that matters in this case is your internet connection. It does.

Have you thought this through?
Let’s assume a keystroke needs 1KB of data. That’s a huge amount for a keystroke, but let’s just assume there’s some metadata and pick a really high limit to how much it might be.
How many such keystrokes can be sent on a gigabit connection in one second? Do the math.
You are correct that the connection is the issue, but the limiting factor is not the throughput, it is the distance that the signal needs to travel.
Personally I’d be okay with sharing a gigabit connection with 99 other people.

Link to what I am working on: https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-the-command-line/lessons/redirection/exercises/pipes?action=resume_content_item
Hello. I am a bit confused on pipelines. So a pipeline takes the output and uses it as an input for the thing on the right.
I get that for example $ cat volcanoes.txt | wc takes the output of the left thing which would be all the names and word counts it, basically wc cat volcanoes.txt
I am confused on this part:
$ cat volcanoes.txt | wc | cat > islands.txt
So the names get piped into wc, giving us three numbers, and piping them into cat??? So would that make wc [number] [number] [number]? But that doesn’t make sense. And then takes the wc and replaces it with the information on island.txt?
","
The output of wc is 3 numbers, which is sent to cat, which doesn’t really do anything, it just repeats, you can remove it without changing the outcome
> writes a program’s output to a file
< writes a file’s content to a program’s input
You could also have written:
wc < volcanoes.txt > islands.txt

Or, since wc can read from files:
wc volcanoes.txt > islands.txt

volcanoes.txt is given to wc as an argument (not stdin). In python you’d find that in sys.argv:
# hello.py
import sys
print('hello', sys.argv[1])

$ python hello.py bob
hello bob

I was learning Python when it told me that I need to learn the command line for some reason. I guess I will need it later on, but what is the command line? Is it the same thing as command prompt on windows? Do programmers use an app for a command line when programming?
Thanks!
","
Commandline is …any interface reading typed commands and responding
What you’re looking for is a unix-like environment, typically that’ll be bash and a quite a large number of other small programs (like touch and mkdir)
There are several environments that come close to this that run on windows. I suggest installing msys2 or wsl, shouldn’t matter which. There’s also git bash, but I’m not sure what exactly it is, it might or might not also do what you want.
If you go with msys2, after following their instructions for installing you can search for python packages with
$ pacman -Ss python

likely the package you are looking for is named one of: python, python2, python3
which would then be installed with:
$ pacman -S python

For wsl I believe it would be:
$ apt update
...wait little bit while it updates its index
$ apt install python3

If not, well, google it.

What’s going on with apt/pacman is that both those systems have curated lists of packages that you can download and install, and those programs are used to download/install/uninstall and other similar tasks

The most important thing for getting what you want is to keep in mind that YOU have to decide what you want to happen, these tools have very few opinions and are there to do as you tell them.
This is contrast to windows which usually only offers a very small amount of buttons where each action makes sense.

What is the difference between touch and mkdir?
They are both creating a file in the folder, aren’t they? Or is touch creating a folder inside your directory as a child director and mkdir creating like a directory outside the folder you are in?

Whoops, sorry. Edited to add link.

wc is a command, and I’m guessing the -l switch is for line count, not word count. Including blank lines, there are five in all.

 5  77 503

which one may deduce to be line count, word count, character count, all combined.

You type in the command line using nano as the editor program

nano  [file name you want to open including the directory path]

nano ~/.bash_profile      is typed in at the command prompt

Please post a screenshot showing the bug.

3 posts were split to a new topic: 2. Nano

It’s definitely a bug.  I literally copied and pasted the text from the instructions into the command line (step by step) and it worked that way.

For saving : Ctrl + O (use keyboard)
For Exit :Ctrl + X(use keyboard)

These are functions, and when executed in order they are working but not checking the instruction #2 to allow user to move on. I have not seen one thread solve this for anyone,. From: Stuck Where You Are.

Ok, and my terminal won’t allow copy/paste functions by clicking or ctrl codes.

nikkyaaryan, somehow your instruction is so much more clear. A thousand thank yous!

Thanks to your clarity and some good old fashioned obsessive persistence I got past step three, kept resetting exercise, could not get my bad text to go away, arrows stayed green so it was hard to know where my mistakes were.
After finding your code (3 day search) advice i whizzed through and finished.

I got the same problem. I have done all the steps 3 times now, but I cannot get past it. I guess I’ll keep trying then.

142,I just can't input ~ (stuck at 79%),"Get Help,Command Line",,21,"
Hello, I am stuck in the third question of 79%… (.bash_profile exercises)
Notice that I am using Linux Mint and for some reason I cannot type nor paste ~
into the codeacademy console command (even using virtual keyboard I
can’'t type it)…
However I managed to bypass the previous exercises using the absolute directory: /home/ccuser/
Well… I did all the 4 instructions but the 3rd instruction never goes green.


Open ~/.bash_profile in nano —> nano /home/ccuser/.bash_profile (step 1 goes green)


Insert: alias pd=“pwd” in the file, save, exit and clear console (step 2 goes green)


source ~/.bash_profile --> source /home/ccuser/.bash_profile (step 3 WON’T go green)


try pd command … and it works! it does the same as pwd command, besides step 3 and 4 not having a green…)


I don’t know what else to try:
I tried to make it work using the absolute pathway, or changing to the current directory: cd /home/ccuser/
I am still stuck on step 3 besides having fully understand the exercise -_-

Hey methodbaster13758,
I got through this exercise with the following:
Step 1: type (w/o the "" "" 's): nano ~/.bash_profile
Step 2: In nano, type: alias pd=“pwd”
2A: Hit ‘Control - O’ (the letter)
2B: Hit ‘Enter’
2C: Hit ‘Control - X’
2D Type in ‘clear’
Step 3: Type in 'source ~/.bash_profile
Step 4: Type ‘pd’
It looks like you are adding un-ncessary stuff in step 3 (and 1 for that matter); I didn’t use the’ /home/ccuser’ command but I think you are unable to use that due to your Linux Mint.  Seems odd you can’t use the tilde (~) button.  If that’s the case, I don’t think the steps above will help because that’s beyond me! Sorry.
That should get you through this exercise.  NOTE: You will need to remember the ‘Control - X’ and ‘Control - O’ to get through the next few steps.  I’m still on 5. Aliases II at 83%, so look for my new thread for help on that if you get past it, thanks and I hope that helps.

Hey man!
Thanks for trying to help =) I really appreciate it.
I’ll try later on a Windows of a friend (which is an irony, because this course is about command line, in other words, linux).
Hope I won’t get more bugs from now on, because I’m ■■■■ sure this is a bug.
Just a note, that ~/somefile is the same thing as /home/{user}/somefile
If you enter cd ~ (a command which I believe you already learned, you’ll change to the home directory) and then if you enter the pwd command, you will see that the user home is /home/ccuser/
I’ll move on, on a Windows PC and then I’ll try to help you, once I pass that exercise.
Thanks mate

Hey, I just wanted to point out two things:

I use Linux too, and didn’t have any trouble with the course. As long as you’re following instructions correctly, I don’t think the OS will make a difference
The Command Line course is covering the Unix command line, and covers Unix commands. Linux and Apple are both based off of Unix, and so share a lot of the same commands, but the course isn’t built for either of those OSes specifically.


So I should try to install other browser (I’m using firefox)?
The only thing that keeps me from mimicking the exact commands is the impossibility of typing nor pasting the ~ on the command line.

Never could type ~ on the command line of codeacademy, I have been using the absolute directory (/home/ccuser) but now is not working anymore (I guess they expect exactly the ~ to aval the exercise)
The virtual keyboard also does not work.
I can’t paste the character.
The ALT+126 (ASCII code for ~) also does not work.

I’m out of ideas. 
What OS and browser are you using?

I was also using Firefox, but switching browsers would be a good idea.
That’s really weird. Normally using the ASCII code works for people. What keyboard layout are you using? Switching temporarily if you’re using anything other than QWERTY might also solve your problem.
EDIT:
Oh and I missed the last part of your post 
I’m using Firefox Developer Edition 43.0a2 (I think) on Peppermint 6, with a Dvorak keyboard.

It’s a QWERTY keyboard,
I just installed the chromium browser and finally I can insert the ~ char. 
It still bugs me why I can’t do it on firefox, but what the ■■■■… It’s a bug and it’s not my fault.
Thanks for the comment zystvan.
And mtharris22, I’ll get to the 83% in no time, and will help you with exercise 5. (83%) 

Hey man, I just got to 86%. where exactly are you stuck at?
Does your ~/.bash_profile contains:
alias pd=“pwd”
alias hy=“history”
alias ll=“ls -la”
export USER=“marco”
PS: “marco” is my name, you can write whatever you want there.
after writing this on the file, save and exit.
Then: source ~/.bash_profile
and finally type: echo $USER

Sadly, the command line on code academy doesn’t recognize the virtual keyboards way of writing ~. The solution for your problem is to use the keys ALT-N to get ~ in the command line for code academy (it worked for me at least).

Hi,
For some reason I cannot get past step 2. I’m able to open up ~/.bash_profile in nano. I’m typing
alias pd= “pwd”
hitting Control + O
hitting ENTER
screen says “wrote 6 lines of code”
hit Control + X
typed CLEAR and pressed ENTER
and step 2 is never showing as completed.
Anyone know what I’m doing wrong?




 jay_chill:

ast step 2. I’m able to open up ~/.bash_profile in nano. I’m typing


remove the space between the pd= and ""pwd"" and make ABSOLUTELY sure that there is nothing more into the file…
better… remove the .bash_profile before editting it in nano, just to make sure 

i think I’m dyslexic between 12-3am

Thanks for the reply. I finished the exercise. It was pretty smooth sailing after that hiccup.  Glad to hear you figured it out with the ‘~’ !

try ALTGR+numpad3.
Atleast thats how I got it working

Hello,
I cant get past Step 2.
First i used commandline:
$ nano ~/.bash_profile
(this gets me through step 1 and turns green)
It gives me this output then:
$ nano ~/.bash_profile
echo “Welcome, Jane Doe Nano”
For step 2 i then type alias pd=“pwd” command below it so:
$ nano ~/.bash_profile
echo “Welcome, Jane Doe Nano”
alias pd=“pwd”
Ctrl+O
Enter
this returns message: [wrote 3 lines]
Ctrl+X
clear
Step 2 doesn’t turn green now…
Anyone knows what I’m doing wrong?

I’m having this exact same problem, mr_paull. Anyone have any ideas?

I get the answer
You need to save it first.
1.Which is “control+O”
2.and then press “Enter”
3.And then “control+x” (exit nano)
then the second step turns green 
Good luck!

Hey Jay_Chill!
I dont know whats wrong… it worked for me

Man, this is weird.

143,A problem with ls -l on BASH Manipulation,"Get Help,Command Line",,3,"
If anyone is reading this right now, I really need help on BASH in unit 2 of step 3 for Manipulation ls-l.
In step 3, it is telling me to try out another option for the ls command by saying to first navigate to the comedy/ directory.  So, I then typed in
ls -l comedy/
but the check mark in the box never came up.  I thought I made a mistake in typing, but I didn’t.  I tried retyping it, refreshing the page, and even tried typing in other things that could be the answer other than ls-l comedy/ such as ls-comedy, ls -l, or comedy, but still nothing.  I don’t know what’s wrong with this and I need help now.  It won’t let me move on, and I know that what typed in can’t be wrong.  Can anyone help me?  If so, please respond ASAP.  Thanks.
","
It’s asking you to manipulate ls -l to view another directory that’s not in the immediate directory. In this case, you’ll need to do ls -l /path/to/directory. You need to to know the file path prior to using ls -l to navigate to that directory.
You can also do ../directory if it’s one directory above or ../../directory if it’s 2 directories above you, but that depends on the directory structure you’re in.

Hello Oduffy,
Here is the problem I’m having with the Command Line.  Here is the direct URL:
https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-the-command-line/lessons/manipulation/exercises/cp-ii?action=resume_content_item
It is the first instruction on the page 6/10. It tells you to type the following: cd …/…/comedy. When I type this,
Navigate to the comedy/ directory.
cd …/…/comedy
it doesn’t  put me back at the comedy working directory. The only way to get to the working directory from there is to type “cd comedy” So you can’t move forward to the next instruction. I restarted from the beginning four times and I get stuck in the exact spot. I use IE 11, I also used Chrome, and still it’s the same problem. I do this from home, not school. I do the CodeAcademy in the evening after 5:00 pm. I would like to sign up for Pro, but if I can’t get through this, I won’t be able to do the projects.
Thanks,
Christina

Use two dots to go up one directory level. The following goes up two levels.
../../comedy

Hello,
Thank you for your feedback, I tried going back one level with the cd … , it still doesn’t work. Did you experience this?
Thanks,

Let’s have a look at where you are currently situated in the directory tree…
ls

to see what content your present working directory holds.
pwd

to see the complete path to that directory.
The first step would be to Refresh the page. Then at the prompt, type,
pwd

and Enter. you should see,
$ pwd
/home/ccuser/workspace/movies
$ 

Now just to quickly restore where you were,
cd drama/biopic
ls

You should see,
$ cd drama/biopic
$ ls
cleopatra.txt frida.txt lincoln.txt notorious.txt ray.txt
$

Now we are two levels below the parent directory that holds comedy. Type the following to change the directory to comedy…
cd ../../comedy
ls

You should see,
$ cd ../../comedy
$ ls
satire shrek.txt the-office.txt
$

THANK YOU SO MUCH, I had no idea what I was doing wrong!! blessings!! Finally I can move on 

Same issue on 5.
Here’s another way to use cp.
Navigate to the action/ directory. Type
cd …/…/action/   and the two directions after that.  When I type ""ype
cp m*.txt scifi/"" I get no such file, but yet, I get a green tick mark and it lets me move on.  This is strange.

The SCT must have seen a correct pattern and accepted it. Not so with the terminal, it would seem. Best try to work this one out. Take your time, you’ve got the check mark so refresh all you need to start over from scratch.




 cheweetina:

Navigate to the action/ directory


Refresh and then at the $ prompt,
cd comedy/satire
ls

You should see,
$ cd comedy/satire
$ ls
fight-club.txt shrek.txt the-office.txt
$

Now we can follow the later instructions.
cd ../../action
ls

You should see,
$ cd ../../action
$ ls
matrix-reloaded.txt  matrix-revolutions.txt  matrix.txt scifi superhero
$ 

Note that scifi and superhero are directories (no file extension).
Now we’re set to carry out the next instruction. The objective will be to copy any text file beginning with m to the scifi directory.
cp m*.txt scifi/
cd scifi
ls

You should see,
$ cp m*.txt scifi/
$ cd scifi
$ ls
matrix-reloaded.txt  matrix-revolution.txt  matrix.txt terminator.txt

can you please post a full screenshot?

I had the same issue! Its not allowing me to go to the next step. Perhaps because I was moving from directory to directory and then decided to do the challenge? I checked my work multiple times, what I did was correct, it simply will not process or allow me to move forward.


7321851c1e6e0a30cdc92c9dac568aeeff96f152.png2102×1480

I am using Chrome.

I had already attempted to move on to the next step and created the media directory, hence why that is showing in the list.

Experiencing the same problem at the moment, impossible to move up the instructions so to speak. I thought I was doing something wrong at first but now I’m not so sure!

Same here, tried both direct cd feb from ls and also long one cd /home/ccuser… /2015/feb
neither of them worked.
Didn’t work on Firefox either.

Instruction:

Change the directory to the 2015/feb/ directory
cd ../feb

List all files and directories in the working directory.

so i have to come feb directory typing this command.
try this

reset your code(now you are in /home/ccuser/workspace/blog)
go to jan directory first(cd 2015/jan)
then cd to feb (cd ../feb)

@uponatime @arkly @kath_hedlund
Hope it’ll help 

The same problem.
Kindly check and resolve bug.

Did it but didn´t work. Still stuck 

Same problem. Can someone please resolve this?

I figured out why it does this. The lesson “wants” you to use the … command in sync with the /feb directory to change everything in one step (that’s why it says type “cd …/feb”)
basically it only “checkmarks” you if you use the … (move up one directory) in sync with changing to the feb folder.
Took me a few minutes to figure this one out.

I had the same issue and despite trying to change everything in one step, it only worked once I went back to the previous lesson and started over:

Was having the same problem but I found out what was wrong. You need to close off ‘feb’ just like you do with cd jan/memory/. Wish they would have specified that. Start over from the beginning so it clears your code and remember to close off with “/”.

Bug still exists

149,Recursive -R,"Get Help,Command Line",,4,"
a recursive function is one that calls on itself
how is that different on the command line
and what does it exactly do
","



 drnikhil:

a recursive function is one that calls on itself


yes, recursive functions is one example of recursion. Just like cucumber is a vegetable, but a cucumber isn’t the only vegetable, just like recursive function calls isn’t the only recursion.
The specific meaning of “recursive” in this context is “operating on a directory and its contents, including the contents of any subdirectories”.
The word “recursive” is used here, because at least conceptually, this is easily implemented by a recursive algorithm:
procedure check_in_directory (d : directory)
    for each entry e in d             <== recursive exit after last entry in directory
        if e is a file
            check_in_file(f)
        if e is a directory
            check_in_directory(e)     <== recursive call

The recursive structure of this procedure matches the recursive definition of a directory:


A directory contains zero or more directory entries


A directory entry is either a file or a directory


This approach – writing a function whose structure matches the definition of the data type you are processing is often referred to as structural recursion.




 drnikhil:

how is that different on the command line


The command line is essentially the almighty as far as the computer is concerned. Give a command and expect a response. If you hand the computer a recusive function then it better have a base case that lets it escape or expect a crash (or freeze up, or out-of-memory error). Recursion eats up a lot of memory fast, and in infinite mode it eats it all up. All of it. Then freezes, or crashes, or politely issues a nice error message, depending on the system. Don’t expect happy endings to commands that include recursive operations unless you really know what to expect.

If you look at the returned messages, you don’t have a historical/ directory. Did you try running mkdir historical/ at the start? Or were you supposed to and it just didn’t work right?

If the directory history/ exists in one place, and you go to a different place, then you probably shouldn’t expect history to also exist there
It’s a file tree. Same as what you have when you use whatever graphical file tree explorer. Same reasoning applies, there’s probably nothing here anyone could tell you that you don’t already know.

I am not getting the proper meaning of ‘<’ and ‘cat’ in Bash. So it would be greatly appreciated if  someone tells me about it in a simple way.

","
cat is a very simple program that repeats what it reads
if a filename is provided cat reads from that file, otherwise it reads from standard input
< is an operator in bash that redirects the content of a file to standard input, similarly, > redirects standard output to a file
So, yes, cat can be used instead of < , but you would additionally need to pipe cat’s output into the next program with | so < would make more sense in that case unless cat somehow fits better anyway
also, a whole lot of programs, similar to cat, accept a filename to read from, so neither cat or < would be needed in those cases

The more obvious consequence is destruction of an existing file when we declare a new file of the same name.

That’s all quite self-evident isn’t it?
If you make a name refer to something new, then it refers to something new, and no longer to the old.
The mkdir on my system refuses to overwrite though, and I suspect yours does too.

No. It will throw an error since there cannot be anything following a switch.

From alias's perspective it is invoked like this by you:
['alias', 'hy', '=', 'history']

(first argument being the program name, then the arguments)
alias expects alias definitions to be a single argument, like so:
['alias', 'hy=history']

You provided three, none of which were aliases or alias definitions.
Compare what you wrote to the example.

Hey, thanks.
So I use to many spaces? 

It’s entirely allowed to have spaces, so I wouldn’t say too many spaces
You’re sending text to alias, and that text needs to match what patterns it is programmed to handle.
If you run one of these:
alias --help
help alias
man alias
info alias

(which one causes alias to print help depends a bit on what exactly alias is and how it’s been installed and whether manpages/infopages are set up…)
It’ll tell you that this pattern is:
alias [alias-name[=string]...]

Where the brackets means optional and … means one or more occurrences
So the program name, and then each argument is either an alias name, or an alias name immediately followed by = followed by any text

how do I type in alias directive?

Ok, sorry that I am being dense this morning, but what is alias directive and how do you type it in?

When you have opened the bash-profile file, type in,
alias pd=""pwd""

as shown in the instructions.

ok, can you tell me how to open the bash profile.  Is it just “nano”

Should be something like,
nano ~/.bash_profile

When it opens, type in the alias directive above,
then press Ctrl+0,
then Enter,
then Ctrl+X.

Thank you for the clarification, mtf.




 mtf:

nano ~/.bash_profile


ok, I do that, and I have to save the file (twice), and I still can’t proceed to the next step.  I’m just getting a blank screen.  Thanks.

At the start of a new session, enter the first instruction to open the bash_profile in nano…
nano ~/.bash_profile

The screen that comes up should look like this…

aebe09beb7a4d07398bd98ff6724d978d9ae762d.png763×555 5.9 KB

Notice in the header bar that it indicates we have to file open in the editor.
In the editor, type the second instruction…
alias pd=""pwd""

Write the file back to the home directory with Ctrl + O. The editor window should look like this…

alias.png854×569 8.86 KB

Notice in the footer bar File Name to Write: ... is the one we have open. Press Enter to complete writing. The footer bar will now say [  Wrote 1 line  ]. Now Exit with Ctrl + X to close the editor.
Type clear and Enter it. Now type pd and Enter and it should show the present working directory just as would pwd.

Isn’t the count explanation within the exercise? Can you link the exercise?

https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-the-command-line/lessons/manipulation/exercises/ls-l?action=resume_content_item

I didn’t really get the explanation
what did parent directory link and current directory link mean?
And i saw in another post that the files and directories were not counted??



 stetim94:

the column only displays the number of hard links, which is 4 for action:  current directory .  parent directory of action …  parent directory of scifi …  parent directory of superhero …  which is 4.  so it counts the number of hard links in child directories, yes, but doesn’t count the directories or files


I do apologise if it’s a very dumb question, just very new to all of this 

its say right here:
Number of hard links. This number counts the number of child directories and files. This number includes the parent directory link (…) and current directory link (.).
for example in the lesson:

4 make sense for the action directory:
current directory (.)
parent directory (..)
scifi directory in action directory
superheroes directory in action directory

just a bit confused about what a current directory link is？

ls -a will show all hidden files, include .. (parent directory) and . (current directory), which are hard links
if we want to execute a script in the current directory, we can do ./scriptname.sh or something. . here indicates the current directory. If you just did scriptname.sh, it would look in PATH

So I get that the contents of volcanoes.txt are piped into wc but why is it piped into cat? It seems redundant because wc will already have and output which will overwrite  islands.txt.
Is there a difference between
$ cat volcanoes.txt | wc | cat > islands.txt
and
$ cat volcanoes.txt | wc > islands.txt
?
I tried both and both yield the same result. I just want to understand the conceptual difference I suppose.

hello @jamierachael
Are you seeing the bottom bar in nano?
if not then try zooming in and out until you see it.
As far as I remember this also happened with me and that bottom bar wasn’t visible
On pressing ctrl + o you’ll be asked in nano to confirm the filename so y’ll have to press enter for that.

Thank you! I also read a few other threads stuck on the same part. I ended up returning to the very first part of the Nano lesson and resubmitting my answers, then it gave me the check.

177,Nano Ctrl + O doesn't work,"Get Help,Command Line",,7,"
Instructions say:
We’ll begin by learning to use a simple, command line text editor called nano.
In the terminal, type
nano hello.txt
This will open the nano text editor.
2.
In nano, at the top of the window, type
""Hello, I am nano.""
I did that.
Then the instructions say:
Using the menu at the bottom of the terminal for reference, type Ctrl + O (the letter, not the number) to save the file. This is the letter “O”, not the number zero. (so do I type; “Ctrl + O” , “Ctrl O” , “CtrlO”? I’ve tried all three and nothing happens. No promt about file name as it says would happen below. and when I try Ctrl + X, nothing happens either.
Press Enter, when prompted about the filename to write.
Then type Ctrl + X to exit nano.
Finally, type clear to clear the terminal window. The command prompt should now be at the top of the window.

Hold down the Ctrl key and press o.

https://www.codecademy.com/en/courses/learn-the-command-line/lessons/environment/exercises/environment?action=lesson_resume&link_content_target=interstitial_undefined

OK. That part of the instructions should be re-phrased. It say’s “Type Ctrl”. When in fact, your pressing the control button and the O at the same time. So this is just a simple Open command?




 vernontnh:

a simple Open command?


Open for writing, yes. That command writes the contents to the file. Watch the message line where it asks you to confirm and press Enter. Then Ctrl-X to exit.

It isn’t clear – did you first save and exit your .bash_profile before you ran the source command?  – because that is what you must do.

it is not allowing me to save, nano is not showing thats the issue i am having. thanks




 seadakrem:

it is not allowing me to save


Are you doing the following
To save:

pressing and holding the control key
while still holding the control key, press the o (letter) key
that should offer you a filename, press enter/return to accept it

To exit:

pressing and holding the control key
while still holding the control key, press the x key

If you examine the output about a quarter way down your screenshot we see that you are currently in the same directory as drama, so you should not enter,
cd ../drama/biopic/

because that takes you up a level above.
cd drama/biopic/

When in doubt, just ls to determine what directory you are in.

ok.  What directory should I be in?  When I put in ls, this is what comes out: node_modules package.json workspace

the top level we are concerned with is,
cd ../
bash: ../ Is a directory

This tells us we are at the top.
$ ls
action comedy drama genres.txt

Given this level, we can now navigate to,
$ cd drama/biopic/
$ ls
cleopatra.txt frida.txt lincoln.txt notorious.txt ray.txt


ok, not to be dense, I just started this 3 weeks ago.  Should I physically type in:$ ls
action comedy drama genres.txt

No, don’t type the $, that is the input prompt. I only included it so it would resemble the console. Just type ls, and the output should look like the next line shown which is also only included so you could see the output.

well, the easiest solution would be a different computer with a working control key
you could also use vim, another command line text-editor, to open/create hello.txt with vim type: vim hello.txt
but vim is very complicated text-editor to use, this is what you need to do after opening vim with vim hello.txt. Press i, this will get you in insertion mode (it should say so at the bottom)
then type the text, Hello, I am nano.
then press esc (escape key), then type :wq
which should save (w of write) and quit the file, and hopefully pass the exercise
if you get stuck in this editor, which might happen, press the escape key a few times, and then type :q!, which means quit without saving changes

Thank you stetim94!!

Did it work? Not sure the exercise approves it using a different editor, and vim is difficult to use

At first it did but the esc key brings me to the ipad homescreen.[Update: the esc key does not exist on this keyboard but there is an equivalent key which I used]

in the terminal, type:
echo ""imap jj <Esc>"" >> ~/.vimrc

and hope that codecademy allows it. now pressing jj in insertion mode (within vim) should act as the escape key.
i should really find a different PC if i where you, you are making things very complicated for yourself

I am setting up a raspberry Pi Computer, That is why I am learnig Terminal.

Yes, then the terminal is particular useful. But a computer for the codecademy course is recommended. Also, for your raspberry, set up SSH server, then you can just operate the raspberry from a computer, once you have setup SSh you can setup VNC for a graphical interface

What is VNC ??
Also, I have ordered a keyboard but it will not arrive this week.

Virtual Network Computing, which allows you to view your raspberry pi on a different computer within the same network. So the raspberry pi can be used on its own (without screen). VNC can also be virtual, so even though your raspberry is only running a command line interface (CLI), we can still view a GUI (graphical user interface) of the raspberry, on a different computer.
if we google raspberry vnc we get this:
https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/vnc/
which is quit useful.
Or did you plan to use the raspberry as an actual computer with a screen attached to it? Not so common, but possible, then you don’t need VNC

I am using the pi as it’s own computer for the most part.
However I want to be able to SSH into it for updates and terminal.

My question doesn’t really concern one of the excercises but is more a general question. I hope this doesn’t conflict with the forum rules (yes, so far I have been to lazy to read the forum rules, for this is only the second time actually checking it out, and first time using it)
So do I understand correctly when I’m saying that Git is used as a substitute for a writing program like Notepad++ ?
If not, what makes them different?
If yes, are there occassions it would be better to use something else (again: like notepad++) than Git?
Thanks for the help.

That’s like comparing a chair to a banana. Not a whole lot in common whatsoever.

After spending some time I figured as much:stuck_out_tongue:
So correct me if I’m wrong (and you’re willing to) but Notepad++ would be (or could be) the working directory and Git is used to track and save the changes made there.
If this is correct it raises the question: ‘what’s the practical use of tracking these changes?’.
I’m sorry if I’m asking question that sound really dumb. I am trying to understand every underlying aspect. Appreciate the help!

np++ edits text files, a directory is something part of a file system which is provided by the OS
Being able to track multiple branches and going backwards and forwards in time, finding out when something was changed and by who, and how, and why, and all kinds of things that I’m not able to think of, are important, especially as the size, time, and number of people grows

The operating system (very likely windows or mac) you use has something called a filesystem, which consist of files and directories
the working directory simple refers to the directory you have open, this can be by using windows file explorer on windows (which can you use to navigate the file system), so for example c:\users\your_user\Documents could be the working directory.
Notepad can save files to the file system.

ionatan gave a good description of what git does. If you make a change to a file using notepad++, but then find out that this change is no good, or it gives a bug in your program, git allows you to view the changes you made and even roll-back to an earlier version of the file. This is just one example, git can do much more. As described by ionatan

Thank you guys for the clear explanation! This clarifies a few important things for me. Much appreciated!

I’m following the directions on how to navigate through the directories and yet, my boxes aren’t checking off as complete.


I created the file ‘shrek.txt’ and followed step 2 and 3, yet those boxes didn’t check off as complete either.


Am I not entering the code in correctly because when I check my statements with the ‘ls’ and ‘pwd’ commands, they see to have populated in their respective categories.

It is odd that you found yourself in /home/ccuser/workspace/movies to being with, the previous lesson would have left you off in /home/ccuser/workspace/movies/drama/historical. This, in turn, would have allowed you to successfully run the cd …/…/comedy command.
perhaps try:
/home/ccuser/workspace/movies/drama/historical
cd ../../comedy


Had same thing happen!  Thank you for sharing and thank you help desk

Thank you so much for clarifying
the program reset after idle time
previous code lines were gone - resets you to scratch
nice to know the program wants the code an exact way previous in order to continue forward.

ok I tried what you suggested. because I’m logging back into the course, the termial resets and the code is blank - so then I try to manipulate and follow the code you suggested.  eventually getting to/ adding that cd … / …/ comedy  command/step. it is still not  continuing onto the next instructions. I understand how to get through all the instructions for cp II. I’m trying to continue onward to finish command line as a requirement for a class.  help would be greatly appreciated!

198,What about windows?,"Get Help,Command Line",,10,"
Can someone tell me where to learn the windows command line? because the command line offered here is useless to me, I can never buy a mac, what do I do???
","
well, windows has cmd and powershell, both of which have plenty of tutorials online, just go out and find them
mac is by far not the only operating system using BASH. Bash is the default shell in many *nix based and derivative operating system such as freeBSD and Linux. I don’t buy it you can’t afford Linux
speaking of Linux, many webservers run linux, so being slightly familiar with the deployment environment if you want to do web development, is quit useful.
some of the companies that use linux include: google, amazon, codecademy, facebook, amazon, twitter and NASA. And many more, but too many to list here
codecademy teaches mostly web development, so a course for Bash makes more sense then cmd/powershell
google took linux (kernel) as a starting point for android, Linux is everywhere, and will be for many years/decades to come

my answer my sound a bit harsh, but now you know that you are looking for CMD (which isn’t much) or powershell (which is what you should learn for serious tasks), finding the tutorials should be pretty easy 
and i just wanted to let you know that there is more to bash then just macOS

Thanks for the help, I am a bit clear on this regard; I was just hoping CMD would be available on codecademy but alright, I’ll look it up

i wouldn’t learn CMD, you can move some files and do some very basics stuff. Then learn bash and look how you can apply those commands in CMD
Windows has the habit of adding new features (powershell) then improving the existing code of already existing feature (cmd)
for anything else, use powershell, powershell is much more powerful

Okay thanks, I only want to learn it is because I want to deploy a website and this course isn’t in CMD so that confuses me; I mean, would it still be usefull or not?

so you can think because you can do one thing with tool x (bash) you can do the same with tool y (cmd)? It doesn’t work like that. Install the right tool for the job
Then just install WSL (windows subsystem for linux) if you have windows 10:


docs.microsoft.com



Install the Linux Subsystem on Windows 10
Installation instructions for the Linux Subsystem on Windows 10.





if you have an older windows version you can install cygwin or consider other means of installing Linux (dual boot, VM)
What you currently attempting to do, really requires Linux (or mac). But linux is free and can be installed on your PC.

Right thank you! I do have windows 10, I will get right to it, the subsystem should be an immense help

On one hand it’s good to learn the os you’re using, on the other hand perhaps the os to use for such tasks isn’t windows
(because of vendor lock-in and because it’s a proprietary product)
You could argue for learning the os that you are using, and I would agree. There’s no clear cut here.
I’d say you should learn powershell if you specifically want to mess around with windows-y things. And I’d say you should stay away if the purpose is to make neutral things, and instead pick something more neutral (bash and the things you usually find there)

200,Command line how to use,"Get Help,Command Line",,4,"
Excuse me. On the Command prompt i cannot do pwd or all the command lines i have learnt in here. Can you show me how to practice in the real command line?
","
What command line? Because the term really refers to anything asking for input in a text interface
The course is about bash and a few tools usually found in the same environments
Non-windows servers tend to run without graphical interfaces (no point spending resources on that for a machine that’s only used from remote locations). The way that you use those machines is generally by typing commands into bash. Text interfaces are far easier to automate and use remotely. Some also prefer to use them because it’s easier to express what you want to do by typing it than to pray there’s a button for it.

Do you run a windows computer and attempt to run the commands there?
That won’t work, the courses teaches Bash. Which is not part of windows.

If man is supposed to be there, then it’s an oversight in CC’s environment.
Otherwise, simply not installed, same as anything else

How do I report errors like that to Codecademy?

Is it one? Does an exercise ask you to run man? Which?

No. I don’t believe it does.

Then there’s nothing to report.
Lots of things aren’t installed, there’s nothing invalid about it
If you’re looking for a man page, you should be able to find them online (though possibly for a slightly different program version than happens to be on your system)

Ok. Thanks for the help.

how to see my filesystem tree in my current lesson?

See? See how? What do you consider the root? / ? /home/ccuser/ ?
You could use ls recursively:
ls -R
There’s also a utility called tree which produces output that’s easier to read. That’s probably not installed by default though, and it takes a bit of know-how to install it (thus making ls -R a more suitable solution)

I wanna see a tree like this. Thank you.

I expect someone fired up photoshop or something to draw those in order to show how directories and files relate to each other, to show that it’s the same thing as what you’re used to seeing when you run explorer.exe or finder
The command line is a text interface - doesn’t display images
If the purpose is to visualise, then you’d leave the command line and open up a file explorer, or perhaps you would run a graph drawing program to generate an image
If the purpose is to get a rough idea of what’s in a directory, then you’d use tools like ls, tree, du
If the purpose is to find something, then you’d use something like find or grep

206,Basic Git workflow - Git Commit question,"Get Help,Command Line",,2,"
          The problem I have is with the following exercise:

207,Command Line Course Flaws,"Get Help,Command Line",,4,"
Hello!
I have recently begun to learn the Command Line. However, the course does not work for me. It isn’t something with the computer; it simply states that some files or directories DO NOT EXIST. This often happens when I close the tab and get back into Codecademy.
Also, when going through lessons, the code DOES NOT change. How am I able to advance? Before I even actually do anything and view the files, Codecademy thinks I completed everything. This is slowing me down and stopping me from learning. I can’t see what the commands are doing.
If you make one mistake, it can lead to many others. Also, if you write a lot of code and bash returns things, it fills up the terminal emulator and blocks up the code, making it hard to see. If I open a new file, another bash, it starts replying that the files don’t exist.
If you have any comments on this, or can help, please comment below!
","
I have noticed this as well but there are a few commands to help you for example
PWD will tell you where you are physically
and
CD ~ will take you back to the root (on your computer)
Heads up that when you take the GIT lessons you may encounter this as well there are a few simple commands that will help you there as well, the more you can practice the commands the easier it gets to know where you are and where you were before and where you should go from there

Having the same issues, started to think it was just me being a newb so I went back over it a few times, same errors. Hopefully someone can assist.

cd stands for change directory, which sounds like something you want to do when navigating the file system
if we type: cd --help we get:
cd: cd [-L|[-P [-e]] [-@]] [dir]

so cd is the command, then a bunch op options -L, -@ and so on, not very interesting for now
then we see [dir], which means directory we want to travel to. so for example cd example/ to travel to the example directory

But when I do the cd command the check mark is blank!

according to your forum post, you are the manipulation section. The navigation section:
https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-the-command-line/lessons/navigation/exercises/your-first-command?action=lesson_resume
is before the manipulation section, so you should have been able to find it

the way you made the question implied was a general question about navigating the file system
If you have an exercise specific question, you should include the exercise url, code and error message
okay, for the command line course a screenshot would be more useful then the code, so exercise url, screenshot of the exercise and error message

I am stuck at this point to this is my first day coding so if you could break it down like i am 3 i would really appreciate it.
thank you

Please type pwd and them reply the message, it will help me to know your location

I am having a similar problem. But I have successfully moved all the files where the lesson says to do it. I actually have a little familiarity with the command line. This was just a refresher. The problem is that although I have moved and copied all the files and viewed the directory to confirm that everything is where it should be, I cannot go to the next lesson. The Next button remains disabled, though all tasks have been successfully completed.

Hello @webrockstar93845,
The last step in the exercise is to try out the alias that you have created in the bash profile. So, you just have to enter “pd” in the Terminal, and it should finish coding.

Those are the instructions but what are you having trouble with? Verify each step you do, find out what you have and haven’t done.

I am confused in the same way, however, I do not understand the excercise fully, I did the nano before, and I am stuck on what to do after. Do I use the Jane Doe command or something else?

216,Why there is no use of cat when piping with sort?,"Get Help,Command Line",,4,"
It was explained that when we pipe and cat with wc it will look like that:
cat XXXX.txt | wc | cat > YYYY.txt
and that because that the second cat receive the cat XXX | wc as input (and redirect to YYYY).
So why we don’t do the same with sort?
in sort it shows: cat XXXX.txt | sort > YYYY.txt
why not putting another | cat?
https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-the-command-line/lessons/redirection/exercises/sort?action=lesson_resume
Thanks for the helpers (:
","
Those commands should be written as:
wc XXXX.txt > YYYY.txt
sort XXXX.txt > YYYY.txt
Or if those programs weren’t able to read from files directly:
wc < XXXX.txt > YYYY.txt
sort < XXXX.txt > YYYY.txt
You can chain cat indefinitely since all it does is repeat the same data, it’s often redundant.
When I use cat it’s to display a small file (cause cat will write the file to stdout which is going to show up in the terminal) - or to do the opposite, use cat to read from stdin (the terminal) and redirect to some file (allowing me to paste into a file)
Keep in mind that its namesake is concatenate, this repeating behaviour is just what you get when you concatenate a single file and is seldom needed for using other programs. Redundant use of cat is a pretty common mistake.

Thank you very much Ionatan!

In the quiz “Navigating the File System” for unit 1 of the course “Learn the Command Line”, several questions are asked on material that is not taught in the unit. These questions include “What keyboard key helps you autocomplete commands and names?” and “Which keys on the keyboard allow you to cycle through previous commands?” Two possible solutions:

if we run:

that the source command requires a filename, because the source commands executes from a file, this allows us to make to change (for example to bash profile) and load those changes (using source) so we don’t have to login out/log back in/reboot the entire system!

So, does that mean my mistake is not adding the filename or am I completely off? I’m a wee bit lost.

yes, you didn’t specify a file(name), a file(name) must be specified for the source command (the error says as much)
maybe you need to look into what source does?

I tried on Windows and they are not working like here.

These commands are not the same as windows commands.  Though some, like cd remain the same, others are drastically different.

some command might work, most will not. for example, ls will not work because dir is the windows equivalent



 armin.is.loved:

This course is for unix-based systems such as Linux and Mac OS X


windows isn’t a unix based operating system
this:



 armin.is.loved:

Finder on Mac OS or Windows Explorer on Window


you didn’t read properly. It says we can use bash (the command line taught in this course) to navigate the file system, just like we can use finder (macOS) or windows explorer (windows).
but windows explorer and finder are both GUI programs, this sentence only indicates that we can navigate the file system through command line as we can using certain graphical programs, the only difference is that CLI requires you to type command, where in GUI program you just click. It doesn’t mean we can use what is taught in this course in cmd (the windows command line)
GUI = graphical user interface
CLI = command line interface
cmd (the windows “command line”) isn’t much, if you really want to use a shell, you have to use powershell
windows 10 has a linux subsystem, and there are things cygwin which you can use to run linux commands on windows, but that is still different from using a full linux system

the column only displays the number of hard links, which is 4 for action:

so it counts the number of hard links in child directories, yes, but doesn’t count the directories or files

seems you accidentally submitted your topic a little bit to early. What is the problem with your command line?

When I type “ls” to see what folder I am it says “not recognized as an internal or external command”

the course teaches bash, which is the shell of *nix (based) operating systems, windows isn’t a *nix based operating system.
dir is the command you need on windows

246,Decimals and backslashes,"Get Help,Command Line",,4,"
          More of a general question than anything specific: when changing directories, I am getting mixed messages on the syntax. For example: 
cd comedy/
cd …comedy/
cd …/…/comedy
(An ellipsis is being displayed here instead of the two decimals, but I am using two decimals in these exercises.)
I’m missing how the difference between these three effects the command line since sometimes the exercises accept a certain one of these, and sometimes another.
Not to mention, navigating often returns the bash: no such file or directory message, yet the exercise tells me that I correctly followed the instructions.
","
It depends on the directory where you are and it should be .. not ... .




look at the image.
suppose you are in 2015 directory and you want to go to my-blog directory .then your command should be

cd ..

so we .. to move up one directory. It means parent directory.and if you want to go to feb directory from 2015 then your command should be

cd feb

now if you want to go 2014 from feb then the command should be

cd ../../2014

so it means parent/parent/2014
you can’t go direct by typing

cd 2014

then you’ll get an error  no such file or directory message.It means you want to go to 2014 what is inside feb .
we use / to separate two directories.

I am xperiencing the same.  It seems that I am typing the command correctly, and the exercise allows me to move on, but I get the bash: error message.

every command (which is essential a program) has a manual page which we can acccess with man so for example man cp), -R means recursive, which means all files are copied rescursivly
programs also often have a -h or --help function which is a shorter version of the man page with the options
if you don’t know how to use the manual pages, guess what? there is a manual for it: man man

It says no such file using the relative path. What do I do?

let me correct my answer:
navigate to the satire directory by using the correct relative path.
if we want to travel to a directory in the current working directory we can simply do cd directoryName, that is why its called relative path, the path is relative to the current directory

to get out of directory, please type cd …

I’m using a laptop and to write the “/” I need to press “Alt Gr” and then “Q”. But that just doesn’t work on the terminal.
(and I’m also not able to ctrl + v the “/” sign in the terminal)
here’s a picture of my keyboard:

e644b400c6e39d6831098b2df0f603ea636bc16f.jpg4128×3096

","
Try Fn +  Q

Didn’t work 

Did you hold in the fn key and then press q ? (holding in both)

I can right-click to paste.
I also wrote a script just now to do replacements on the command-line when pressing Ctrl-g, it can be used like this:
$ cd _slash_home_slash_ccuser

Pressing Ctrl+g would change that into:
$ cd /home/ccuser

I’ve added the following replacements:
_slash_      ->  /
_backtick_   ->  `
_at_         ->  @
_backslash_  ->  \
_tilde_      ->  ~
_dollar_     -> $

I’m sure I missed a few. Adding more should be simple enough by editing the script and uploading the new version. The shortcut (ctrl+g) can be changed in the script as well.
All that needs to be done is to download it and run it, with no slashes that’s a bit tricky, but if you can type in any of these you’re good to go:
# if you can do pipe (|):
printf 'paste.debian.net\057plain\057837817' | xargs curl -o ins; source ins
# if you can do backtick (`)
curl -o ins `printf 'paste.debian.net\057plain\057837817'`; source ins
# if you can do $
curl -o ins $(printf 'paste.debian.net\057plain\057837817'); source ins
# if you can't do backslash:
curl -o ins `python2 -c 'print ""paste.debian.net""+chr(47)+""plain""+chr(47)+""837817""'`; source ins
# no backslash, no backtick:
curl -o ins $(python2 -c 'print ""paste.debian.net""+chr(47)+""plain""+chr(47)+""837817""'); source ins

The script is here: https://paste.debian.net/plain/837817
The effect only applies to the current terminal session. Making it permanent can be done by adding one of the above lines to .bashrc and/or .bash_input but it would be better to add the script itself, rather than to do a network operation each time a bash session is opened

Thank you SO much! this solved my problem with a “real” terminal, but not with codecademy’s terminal (bc when I press CTRL-T, google chrome opens a new tab lol), so I realized I can just open microsoft’s virtual keyboard to insert

oh I just realized its CTRL-G, did you changed it or I saw things? btw, this was really helpful.

I DID change it! Realized that Ctrl-t is open-tab on windows/linux… derp
Could have lots of shortcuts bound to it all at the same time.
Wait, did you actually get that to work? \o/
Oh. Virtual keyboard… cheating!

Hi all, you can ALSO open Character Map from prompt, just type charmap, select the symbol,copy and paste where you need

You’ve navigated to / and moved yourself out of your workspace directory.  That’s why it’s not working for you.
Walking through your commands
Let’s walk through the stuff that you were typing
cd jan/memory
Changed directories
pwd
Showed you where you currently are in the filesystem.
cd
That took you to your home directory which is home/ccuser
pwd
Showed you that you are in home/ccuser
cd ..
You moved back one folder into the home directory.  Before you were in the home/ccuser, but now you are in the home directory.
pwd
Shows you that you are in home.
cd ../feb
That gave you a No such file or directory error.  Why?
You are in home.  .. would take you to the root.  There is no feb folder there.  You could do a ls to inspect the available files and directories.
The feb directory exists in home/ccuser/workspace/blog/2015.  Right now you are in home.  Look at the path/to that I gate.  home is the first directory.  Therefore, you’d have to do cd ccuser/workspace/blog/2015 to get back to where you want to be.
cd ..2015/feb/
That gave you a No such file or directory error.  Why?  Look at what I told you above.  You are in the home directory.
cd ..
Now you moved yourself to /.
ls
Listing out the files and folders, notice that you are no longer in your home directory.
ls
Same as above
touch keyboears.txt
You got a Permission denied error because you do not have permission to work in that directory.
What do you need to do?
You need to get back into your workspace and into the 2014/dec directory.
Type this:  cd ~/workspace/blog/2014/dec.
Now you do step 2 in the instructions.  Make sure you spell the filename correctly.

Thank you! I’m still confused but got through the lesson. I think I’ll reset it and have another go from the beginning.




 nmandel:

I think I’ll reset it and have another go from the beginning.


That’s an excellent idea.  And then when you get stuck or aren’t quite sure why it’s doing something, stop and think about it.  Check where you are in the filesystem as compared to where the lesson wants you to be.  If still fuzzy, come here and we’ll help you out.

Verify that you are in the correct working directory before moving the files.

How do i do that? What do i have to put in the controller so that it will finish this lesson. Ive tried everything i know and its not working

I found a couple files were missing in my directories so I created them in the respective working directory.
This is the command line from lesson 4 (?) up to lesson 7…
satire  shrek.txt  the-office.txt
$ cd satire
$ ls
fight-club.txt  shrek.txt  the-office.txt
$ cd ../../action
$ ls
matrix-reloaded.txt  matrix-revolutions.txt  matrix.txt  scifi  superhero
$ cp m*.txt scifi/
$ cd scifi/
$ ls
matrix-reloaded.txt  matrix-revolutions.txt  matrix.txt  terminator.txt
$ cd ../
$ ls
matrix-reloaded.txt  matrix-revolutions.txt  matrix.txt  scifi  superhero
$ touch superman.txt
$ ls
matrix-reloaded.txt  matrix-revolutions.txt  matrix.txt  scifi  superhero  superman.txt
$ mv superman.txt superhero/
$ cd superhero
$ ls
spiderman.txt  superman.txt  wonderwoman.txt
$ cd ../
$ touch wonderwoman.txt
$ touch batman.txt
$ mv wonderwoman.txt batman.txt superhero/
$ cd superhero
$ ls
batman.txt  spiderman.txt  superman.txt  wonderwoman.txt
$ mv batman.txt spiderman.txt
$ ls
spiderman.txt  superman.txt  wonderwoman.txt
$ ls -a
.  ..  spiderman.txt  superman.txt  wonderwoman.txt
$

The lines above with touch are where the files were created.

Still comes up with superhero is not a directory

List the contents of the action directory.

you really have to run this command: cd …/drama/biopic/ from the right directory in one go, you can’t break it down into steps, if you break it down into steps, you won’t get a pass

$ cd …/…/comedy


Check to see what directory you are in right now by doing pwd.  It will give you the current working directory.  It may be that you are not where the exercise thinks you should be.
For example, when I go to that exercise now and run pwd, it shows that I’m in /home/ccuser/workspace/movies.  The comedy folder is in that working directory.  So if I run cd ../../comedy I get the same bash error that you do.
What should you do?  Navigate to the movies/comedy folder.
Let me know where you are in the filesystem by running pwd and then I can help you get to where you need to be.

same as u in pwd. /home/ccuser/workspace/movies.

Okay, the step 1 for you is cd comedy to get you into the comedy folder.  Now you can do the rest of the steps.

Thanks but that unfortunately doesn’t fix the issue.

Had the same problem. For some reason it made me navigate to the comedy/ directory using the given line of code (cd …/…/comedy). To do this, I first navigated to the historical/ directory (where the last exercise ended) and then used the code given in the instructions.

Thank you lt_luna. I tried your suggestion by first typing in the given code (cd …/ …/comedy) which didn’t work, then just cut and paste from the instructions and it worked. This seems like a bug. At least I’m moving on!

Im just a little confused with chapter 2 task 4. I dont feel the commenting and explaing match up with the result im getting in the command line when doing:
ls -la
<Below this line, describe in what way does your code behave incorrectly? Include ALL error messages.>
It says : “Number of hard links. This number counts the number of child directories and files. This number includes the parent directory link (…) and current directory link (.).”
But current directory clearly have 7 hard links? but it says 5 when doing ls -la.
And again doing: cd action. It says 4 hard links but it is 7 when i check.
Also group name seem to be wrong, and date and size of file is opposite order of how discription says.
Not too big a deal i just want it to make sense! Thanks for all replies.

that is 4, it doesn't count files

Hope that clarifies, personally, i have been using linux now for three years, if there is one column i never pay attention to, its that one.

Ok thanks for the reply.
But the quote says “This number counts the number of child directories and files”
What does links refer to when you say: ""…number of directories and links in a directory. ""?
Anyway it seems to make sense so I’ll settle with this answer.
I had Linux before a period when I had an old computer. Ubuntu, I’m just bored and doing some excersices 
Thanks again.




 cssslayer71945:

But the quote says “This number counts the number of child directories and files”


which is not right
Ubuntu is a good start, i used Ubuntu for a while, then i tried a bunch of different distros before settling with arch linux.
I am one of those people who started using linux, and never ever wanted to get back to windows xD

Any I think I read about that one, it’s like the most anti windows distribution. No flirting with windows. Only hard structure in the ways to add programs and so in.
Well well well… I found a true hardcore… heh go with that.

its not anti-windows, its KISS (keep it simple, stupid), it comes with the bare minimum to run your system (command line interface, keyboard support, that is pretty much it, ethernet during installation, but that is pretty much it)
its cool, you truly get to know the system

I’ve learned that you press the run button 3 or 4 times it says “Having trouble?” then it gives 2 options. Get code, or keep trying. I’m not saying you should do it though, unless your really stuck.

Unfortunately when typing code into bash there is no “run” button - you just press enter to execute the last instruction you typed and it automatically validates it.

This is because you’re not in 2014/dec.
You are stuck at /home/ccuser currently.
To find the path,

list all files and directories in ccuser to find workspace (you have)
list all files and directories to find blog
list all files and directories to find 2014
list all files and directories to find dec


I had this issue as well and was finally able to solve it.
There is an issue with typing  cd …/…/2014/dec.
I had to type cd …/…/2014/dec instead of cd …/ …/2014 (this has a space after the first forward slash, which is expected) in order for the code to work.
Hope this helps!

Sometimes the exercise starts in the directory you are supposed to navigate to so typing cd . clears the first step

It looks like you weren’t in the directory that the lesson assumed you’d be in. Right from the first line you’re getting directory errors. ../ makes you go up a directory in your tree but its relative to where you are at that moment. Two very useful commands you can use are ls to LisT the files and directories in your current directory and pwd to Print Working Directory to ensure you’re in the directory you should be.
From the above code it looks like you were told to cd into ‘comedy’ but your relative tree navigation did not find a comedy directory two dirs up. You kept on performing the tasks and I guess the Codecademy Command Line environment was just tracking your inputs and NOT what the results of your actions were. If you reset the lesson and make sure you’re in the comedy directory after your first navigation then the rest should work well.
Except mkdir shrek.txt, a directory does not have an extension. But it looks like you figured that out by touching right after.

thank you so much 

It didn’t work for me I keep pressing reset and it won’t open the terminal after I reset it. I even tried refreshing the page but it would only take me back to the problem with the first instruction checked out.

If you enter pwd and then ls what directory are you in and what files do you see there?

 ls
action  comedy  drama  genres.txt
 pwd
/home/ccuser/workspace/movies

So then can you cd into comedy to continue?
$ cd comedy


$ ls
satire  shrek.txt  slapstick  the-office.txt
$ pwd
/home/ccuser/workspace/movies/comedy

Still doesn’t let me continue.

What is the next pending instruction on the left?

It says “In this directory, create a new file named shrek.txt. (Here’s a hint on how to do this.)”

It looks like that’s already done, but you can try this:
$ rm shrek.txt
$ touch shrek.txt

The first command will delete the existing file, the second will remake it. Let me know if this passes you to the next step.

Thank you. Touch fixed it.

 Hi. I’ve wondered what the differences of “cat filename” and “cat < filename” are?
can anyone explain for me ?
And What is the purpose of using redirection?
Thanks so much.  
","
In this case it’s a very subtle difference, but a difference nonetheless.
cat filename.txt <-- in this case, the program cat opens the file
cat < filename.txt <-- in this case, the shell (i.e. the command line program) opens the file, and passes it to cat as an input.
If you’re interested, there’s more on it here: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/258931/difference-between-cat-and-cat
In terms of its purpose, it depends on what you’re trying to achieve. In many cases, it simply allows you to redirect the flow of data from one source to another, in a simple, single command. For example, you could write ls > file_list.txt to write the contents of a directory straigt into a text file.

Thanks so much.I got it

When moving batman.txt into spiderman.txt it renames batman.txt to spiderman.txt, where does the data in each file go?
<Below this line, add a screenshot of your whole web browser so that we can see what you see.>
","
There are two possible scenarios, where one file exists and you want to rename it, and when both exist and you want to overwrite one with the other.
In the first scenario, by ‘moving’ one file to another, as yet non-existent file, you just change the name of your file. All the file contents remain untouched.
In the second, more complex scenario the first file’s contents stay the same, but the name of the file changes. The other file that used to have that name ceases to exist.
You can test this yourself. Create 2 files in the same directory, batman.txt and spiderman.txt. Put a quote in each file to identify them such as:
batman.txt:
Where’s Rachel?!
spiderman.txt:
With great power comes great responsibility.
Now in your command shell type $ mv batman.txt spiderman.txt. Then do an $ ls. You’ll see that there no longer is a batman.txt file, just a spiderman.txt. If you open spiderman.txt you’ll find the batman quote.

Thank you. That was a perfect explanation.

Are you stuck on step #7? Where you navigate to the destination directory to see if all ‘m’ files were moved?
I know another person had an issue with this same problem that existed because the instructions suggest you are in another starting directory than you actually are.
The instructions direct you to enter $ cd ../../comedy, or go back two directories and enter the comedy directory. Unfortunately this command will fail.
$ pwd
/home/ccuser/workspace/movies
$ ls
action  comedy  drama  genres.txt

Using pwd and ls to acquaint ourselves we see we are already in the “movies” directory and only need to type this to enter the comedy directory.
$ cd comedy

Using relative path finding commands such as ../../ are good for moving around but if you ever get lost, try printing your current directory path and listing the files and folders in it.

pwd stands for “print working directory”. It outputs the name of the directory you are currently in, called the working directory.

Can someone provide me with the correct code for this one. I have tried everything, perhaps a bug on the website?

I still have the same problem even though I had typed it correctly!

Problems get solved by considering what’s going on, identifying the difference to what should happen, and then eliminating that difference. Neither of you appear to be doing any of that right now.
You’re always going to run into situations where things don’t work the first time around, having the “correct code” at hand isn’t useful when it doesn’t apply to the current situation. Better if you ask questions about your situation, consider what information you need, how you can approach your situation, what’s preventing you from solving it.
And in particular, most people aren’t interested in telling you how to do something once, questions like these make it seem like you’re trying to avoid to learn anything, in which case you aren’t making yourself deserving of asking other people for their time to do what you won’t

Great  Advice, but sometimes I may want to see the code to help me understand what went wrong.  Even I get a little thick at times.  I do try everything I can think of first and try many times before success.  I only ask when there is no other alternative.  Add to your advice. "" Don’t give up!""  The answer may be on the next entry.

me too. Iam stuck on this exercise. I do it all and the exercise can’t pass me to further level

Same…can’t get past Step 2.

Got it…I just stared at it until it finally submitted.
In terminal type, (nano ~/.bash_profile), and it will read out the text in the file. The text needs to be (echo “Welcome, Jane Doe”), with “Jane Doe” being whatever name you want, and the next line being (alias pd=“pwd”).

679ac68518fe8b91ccf1e8775712c6994ca29c9b.png1088×152

-If you need to change or edit the text then refer to the commands that appear at the bottom of the terminal screen to do so.
Then follow the commands in nano that are at the bottom of the screen to exit, (Crtl X). When you attempt to exit it will prompt you to save the file. Push Y, and then hit enter to save.
Finally, type Clear in the terminal to clear the terminal (honestly, not completely sure this was necessary).
I believe the program is looking for the exact code. Think of it like a password. If one character is missing then the password fails. I was missing the “s” at the end of “alias”.

I was stuck, but somehow made it work. Here’s my code.

1.JPG773×466 48.2 KB


Part 2:


The code that you suggested copies the file “ray.txt” from the “biopic” folder and then pastes it into the “historical” folder.  For this lesson, we are instructed to copy the file “cleopatra.txt” from the “biopic” folder and then paste it into the “historical” folder.  The code to complete this text is provided in the instructions, and corresponds to the very last line of code in “part 2” of your message (if you were to substitute “ray.txt” for “cleopatra.txt”.  Unfortunately, however, the provided code does not work (see screenshot on the original post for more detail).
Is there some error that I am missing?

Just spent an hour on this - grrr. Having looked it up I might suggest the following which worked for me;

The name of the variable is PS1 - that last is a number, despite the way it looks in the exercise.
After typing the CTRL-O check the filename and manually input ~/.bash_profile if necessary.

The point is that the PS1 variable holds the command prompt ($ by default) and this changes it for the current session.
Good luck!

Same for me :-/
Have reset the lesson and done it again, refreshed, tried different browsers and computers but no fix…

@tomfbush i just now finished 4/11 and it took me a while to complete it but i found out where i was going wrong…so here’s what i learned

to add the alias type
nano ~/.bash_profile
2 then on the next screen type
alias hy=“history”
3 control o
4 enter
5 control x
6 clear
7 source ~/.bash_profile
8 ~/.bash_profile

if you havent already your alias pw=“pwd” to
nano ~/.bash_profile
you might wand to add that alias first

@teraclenin thanks for this, it helped me to finish the lesson.
In practical terms I did almost the same, except I think my initial nano command was nano .bash_profile – I didn’t refer to the home directory. Just assumed that’s where I was. Can’t see any other differences!
Thanks again 
Edit: a quick pwd confirms I was totally wrong to assume I was in ~!

Do one step at a time.
If you’re in/home/ccuser/ , display the files and directories using ls.
From there, move up towards comedy with cd +(directory).
Path to comedy is: /home/ccuser/workspace/movies/comedy
cd .. to go back one directory
cd (+directory name) to move to a directory
ls to display all files and directories
pwd to display the path to your current position

do it comand for the next step

how do you get to the comedy/ directory
","
Three commands can help you navigate:


cd : Change directory. If you wanted to reach Comedy from Movies, you’d type cd Comedy. To go one step back, use cd ..


ls : List files and directories. If you’re in Movies and wanted to see what’s in there, you’d type ls Movies to see all files and directories within that directory, e.g. Comedy, Action, Horror, etc.

pwd : Print working directory. That will give you the path to your current directory. You’d see something like /home/ccuser/workspace/movies


So.

how do you get to the comedy/ directory

You first need to figure out where you currently are. Use pwd.  When you see the path, show the files and directories using ls. Once you’ve figured out where you are, move accordingly using cd or cd ..

Could you please post a screenshot of your code?

as @williamwallacef13 points out, a few more observations need to be made.
What do you expect the file contents to be?
If you open the file, does it match?
What’s the output of running the following?
echo 'echo ""Welcome, Jane Doe""' | diff -s - ~/.bash_profile

It’ll tell you if the file is “identical” or differing, or missing if it’s not even there
Explanation:
echo some text that matches the file contents. This will just print that text
Instead of printing it though, pipe it to the program diff, and compare to the file ~/.bash_profile
-s is for saying that it is identical if it is (otherwise it would say nothing)
- is to tell it to read input instead of looking at a file
Could also have used grep … and probably a dozen other things

Probably, You have missed the “.” after slash in the first step of this lesson )

I tried the code again adding the slash. What I’m really confused of is how to type Ctrl + 0. Thanks anyways

Press it, not type 
press ctrl O

The instructions say:
Type Ctrl + O to save the file.

Press Enter to write the filename.

Type Ctrl + X to exit.

Finally, type clear to clear the terminal window.

When you get to Type Ctrl + X to exit, this should be taking you out of Nano.
Then, once you’ve exited from nano and you’re back in the terminal, you can type clear and that should work.

Hi. Thanks. I did all this, but the “Next” button is nnot lit up to
proceed. Im stuck in this area. So is there anyway to bypass and go on to
“3/11” in the nano?

im in step 2… and I did all you mentioned above. Then there is step 3
and its not clickable or lit up to continue.

Make sure you have the content typed like below exactly. I had a space after = symbol. I fixed it and Next button turned green for me
echo ""Welcome, Jane Doe""
alias pd=""pwd""
alias hy=""history""
alias ll=""ls -la""


Thanks. unfortunately it is still not letting me pass. I am saving the file
too. Control O <------ correct?

I ran into the same issue. I was able to successfully complete the task by making sure to add the directory (""~/"") before the file name when I save. In other words, the file name should be ~/.bash_profile, not just .bash_profile when you are asked.

Hey, so I just took like 25 minutes trying to figure this out haha! Not super easy cause it’s a potential small error. So if you haven’t figured it out yet, my suggestion is clicking “get help” in the bottom right hand corner of the screen and restarting the workspace.
In step one, where it asks you to type nano ~/.bash_profile - do NOT put a space between the / and the (.) - just type it in without the space and move onto the second step and see if that helps at all!
cheers.

Have you tried
pwd  ==>output will be=> drama/historical
cd ..
pwd ==output => drama
ls ==>output => the files in the drama-directory

It might  happen that you lose the $-prompt…
if that happens, it is the indication that the emulated-environment is blocked…
you will then have to leave the environment
and start with a fresh-working-place

1)When we copy cleopatra.txt we copy all filles in directory, why?
2)when we copy i wrote drama/historical/, when i enter wrote pws result was drama/historical (all ok);
but when i write cd drama result was : No much file or directory.Why?
3) I tried wrote cd  result was : /home/ccuser afret i wrote cd drama/ but i has got the same error that was in 2). Why?

Commands used:
cd ==> change-directory
pwd => print working directory
cd /home/ccuser
pwd ==>output /home/ccuser
cd drama
pwd ==>output /home/ccuser/drama
cd historical
pwd ==>output /home/ccuser/drama/historical
cd .. 
pwd ==>output /home/ccuser/drama
cd ..
pwd ==>output /home/ccuser

Thanks You. Very much.

what is the mean of Change directories into historical/.
List all files and directories in the working directory. You should see a new copy of ray.txt and notorious.txt in this directory.**

can you explaiin all of this in terms that an ignorant person will understand please

@devrockstar53243,
As you want to do the command line course
you will have to learn the basic’s of unix/or/one-of-its-derivate’s

Use “cd historical/” then ls -l. You should see it.

Hi what does the lesson ask you to do?

Think you need to use cd comedy/ to get it to navigate. If that’s not your problem I’m sorry, that’s the best I could do

$ cd drama/historial


You spelt historical wrong here in your first command, doesn’t look like you retried it although I’m pretty sure it only wants you to go to drama
cd drama/
Here’s the list I think it should be:

cd drama/
ls
pwd
cp biopic/cleopatra.txt historical/
cd historical/
ls
cd …
cp biopic/ray.txt biopic/notorious.txt historical/
cd historical/
ls


Pay attention to those error messages! They may say a lot about what you need to change to get your desired result.
$ cd drama/historial 
bash: cd: drama/historial: No such file or directory 
$ cd drama/historial drama/ 
bash: cd: drama/historial: No such file or directory 

as @benjnev points out, spelling.

$ drama/historical 
bash: drama/historical: Is a directory 

Here you can see that you’ve found the directory, but you’re trying to execute it and that doesn’t make sense. Or at least, the way we change directory is with cd, not by executing the directory.

$ cp drama/historical 
cp: missing destination file operand after ‘drama/historical’ 
Try 'cp --help' for more information. 
$ cp drama/historical drama/ 
cp: omitting directory ‘drama/historical’ 

Using --help is a good idea, but directories need to be copied with -r (recursive)
besides, it’s already in the location that you are trying to copy it to!

$ cd drama/historical/drama 
bash: cd: drama/historical/drama: No such file or directory 
$ cd drama/historical.txt drama/ 
bash: cd: drama/historical.txt: No such file or directory 
$ 
$ cd drama/historical.txt/ drama/ 
bash: cd: drama/historical.txt/: No such file or directory 
$ cd drama/historical.txt/ drama/ 
bash: cd: drama/historical.txt/: No such file or directory 

Now you’re trying to get at a bunch of stuff that doesn’t exist. You can use ls to list what exists in a directory.

$ cd /drama 
bash: cd: /drama: No such file or directory 

Starting a path with / means that that path starts at the very top (root) of the file-system as opposed to relative to your current location.

$ cd drama/historical

Assuming that the above is a directory, then this probably made you move to that directory. No idea if that’s what you were after or if that’s what you’re intended to do, but hey, the command successfully executed.

Thanks, tobuscus45. This worked for me, though I am still entirely unsure why I couldn’t get past step 3 without using your code. I was able to see the copy of cleopatra.txt I made within the historical/ directory, but CodeAcademy wouldn’t let me go on. I reported the bug, but maybe I was just missing something in my code. Thanks!

If you want to go dec directory from 2014  then your command should be

cd dec

we use .. to go to parent directory.

I am also stuck  in this step. I checked previous discussion about it, though I used “cd 2014/dec/” and then “ls” it is not working.

I am trying to navigate to “comedy” as instructed using the ls command and I’m trying to use pwd to accomplish that. I’m not progressing in this part and I’m unsure why.
<Below this line, add a screenshot of your whole web browser so that we can see what you see.>
","
If you recall from the ‘Navigation’ section, pwd stands for ‘print working directory’, which might mean it’s not the correct command for navigating (changing) to the ‘comedy’ directory.

Always remember when navigating to use your dots and list commands.
example syntax:
cd …      ~ Moves you up on level
ls          ~ Lists contents
cd ./folder_name        ~ one dot = one level if you will in file structure so, one dot plus slash and name gets you in.
Hope this helps

Nano is a command line based text editor which comes installed in every Linux system of which I am currently aware. It is relatively easy to use for quick edits.
When you begin this exercise it tells you to run the command:
nano hello.txt

What this does is open the nano program on a file called hello.txt. If that file already exists, it will open the file. If not, it will create a new file with that name, note the bottom of the screen where it says [ New File ].
With the program open, it wants to you type:

“Hello, I am nano.”

It is the same as any other word processor at this point. The answer checks are pretty specific, so make sure to include the quotations.
The biggest difference is the commands. Obviously you can’t use the cursor to operate the menu, so you have to use the keyboard.
At the bottom of the screen you see various options with a white highlighted block to the left and the meaning to the right. The ^ means to use the Ctrl key to use that particular command. So you would use Ctrl + O which writes out the file, also known as saving. You simply press the Enter key to confirm the file name, then Ctrl + X to close the file altogether.
Finally, you use the clear command to empty the window. This comes in handy if your terminal window gets cluttered, but is not a truly necessary step in real world applications.
I hope that was helpful in explaining the scenario. If you need additional guidance, let me know exactly what part is holding you up and I will try to address it in more detail.
For practical application, you can just use Ctrl + X and if there are unsaved changes it will ask if you want to save them before closing. It is personal preference on how you want to go about saving, I just prefer one command versus two.

If you get that error message then first of all you should check the directory where you are now.(command   pwd)
now consider should it work?

Am I in the wrong directory? Please see attached.
Which directory should I be in, and what’s the exact command to get to the proper directory?

d2aca8f18af6ed87ffa1c306ef7b010bd86aa8de.png1327×723


you are in movies so now if you command like

cd ../

then you’ll go to workspace (parent directory).
and if you command like

cd ../../

then you’ll go to ccuser(parent directory/parent directory).now here you are trying to search comedy directory.
see you file tree structure







 mzsaucy:

Which directory should I be in, and what’s the exact command to get to the proper directory?


you can be anywhere.it’s not the problem.but your command should be according to your position.
so you are in movies and you want to go to comedy.then simply your command should be

cd comedy

suppose you are in drama and now you want to go to comedy.then your command should be

cd ../comedy

First you have to go to parent directory that is movies and then you can go to comedy.

I am confused on the fourth page of aliases.
Once I access nano and type in 'alias hy=“history” ’  then I cannot save and I don’t know what to do from there.
Thank you!
","
What prevents you from saving?

I’m not sure, I keep doing “Control + O” but that doesn’t seem to work

What do you expect to happen and what happens instead?
It doesn’t just “not work”, it does SOMETHING, or NOTHING but “not working” doesn’t describe what that is.
Likely nano tells you what to do next, and what you need to do is to read what it says.
You can also use another editor, or some alternative method of adding that line.
For example, you can append a line like this:
echo 'alias hy=""history""' >> ~/.bashrc

But before you just paste that in and declare it to work, keep in mind that the important part is to be able to do this yourself, not to just get past the exercise.
So what you should do is still to learn how to use nano (which is probably the simplest terminal text editor)

OMG!!! Code Academy’s exercises are frustrating me to no END!!! Why are the instructions in every exercise so messed up and NEVER straight forward? Can Someone give me some guidance on hold to finish exercise 4/11? Nothing posted so far in the forum has worked and I followed all of the instructions to a T.

It’s simply two ways to accomplish the same task.
Let’s say for some crazy reason you have a file names memory and a folder named memory in the same location. Adding the / at the end would make sure you don’t try and cd to the file.
Most people wouldn’t have a file and folder named the same thing in the same place, but it is not outside the realm of possibility as Linux systems do not need a file type extension to know what program to open.

Hi,
so, the / after “memory” designates it as a FOLDER?
and so the “2015” was just a file?
And how does a directory compare to a folder?
thanks,
Megan

No, the were both folders. It was just showing​ you two different ways to cd in to a folder.
Directory and folder are the same thing. Directory is just a more technical sounding word for it.

Now I am in Manipulation, trying to do 5/10. I am getting error messages:  there is no drama directory. I have looked at the help topics in the forum.  Several other people have had the same problem, yet there was no resolution listed. No one said how to fix the problem. I signed in, I pwd. I can see the file movies, but no drama.  how do I get to the drama directory?  (cd … didn’t work)

ce35f62d8224342a68c000db1318bab058a37ed7.png814×493


Looks like i figured out how to get there, but not by following the “Instructions”. I started out above drama, so cd … brought me above drama, not down into drama.

26ce501a73db91f9c6044c43f535ef1fadf8ae60.png948×514


I’m also stuck with 5/10. How can I navigate to the drama/directory
Screenshot (7).png1111×566 36.5 KB


First use pwd to find out where you are.
if you are not “under” or “within” the drama directory, you can write a command to take you there.
$ cd /home/ccuser/workspace/movies/drama
then I did ls to list the files is the directory that I am currently in. (the directory was drama)
when I executed the command ls, it output these 2 files:  biopic historical
so I then knew I could work with these files.
i found that if a command in code academy doesn’t work, i do pwd (print working directory) to figure out what directory i am actually in, then i can navigate elsewhere if needed.

getting the notifications out there… @megbig8 @marinamts @alan-redding
/ separates directory names, it isn’t part of the name. Directories share namespace with files i.e. you can’t have a file and a directory sharing the same name.
Since it’s a separator it usually makes no difference whether you have one at the end. Tab completion might add the / for you, this is so you can continue to type the next name without adding the / yourself (and to let you know that it fully matched)
The one exception I can think of is with links to directories, without the trailing slash you are referring to the link file, but with the trailing slash you are referring to the directory that is linked to.
If you’re not sure where you are or where something else is, pwd and ls can help a lot. ls can print out recursively with the -R option (though it’s not that readable, the tree command (not installed) has a much better representation)
There are (of course) also commands for searching. So one might for example want to search the home directory for a directory named drama:
find ~ -name drama -type d

It looks like when you tried to change to comedy it did not work so nothing after that went through. You tried …/…/comedy but according to the results of you last command, you should have just done cd comedy. Make sure you watch the output as you go through the commands.

Thank you so much Alan! it worked… but I must admit I still don’t get when should I write without the …/ and why sometimes I must type two times this: …/…/

Let’s say you type pwd and it returns:
home/karoona/Documents/example/test

If you want to change to a folder within the same working directory, you would simply:
cd images

Which would take you to the images folder inside test.
You would use …/ to go up one directory such as:
cd ../

Would take you to the example folder.
cd ../../

Would bring you up two directories to the Documents folder.
You can also change directly to another folder in the same way:
cd ../test2

From the original pwd would bring you to the test2 folder inside of example.

<Below this line, describe in what way does your code behave incorrectly? Include ALL error messages.>
When resetting the Command Line from the Get Help button, and then clicking the “I want to reset this exercise” button I found that I am not at the same location within the tree (forgive me if I am using the wrong terminology) as I was when initially starting the exercise. In the exercise I am supposed to use cd …/ to get to the action/ directory. Instead, when I print the directory I am now in (pwd) I am in /home/ccuser/workspace
I have found that despite the fact that I am not in the correct directory, action/, I am still given a pass by the program for entering the cd …/ command. I ended up resolving the issue by entering “cd action/” after typing cd …/ Entering cd action/ right off the bat resulted in being in the correct directory, but does not fly with the instructions as the only way to progerss is by using cd …/
This confused me for a while when I was initially trying to figure out why I was not in the correct directory despite typing the correct input, and I was wondering if anyone else was experiencing the same or a similar issue.
TL;DR resetting the page from the Get Help menu results in being in the incorrect location in the directory.

open the file again and save it
use the Reset this Exercise option (under Get Help). It will put this exercise back to the beginning and you’ll have to do it again.

Please I will need help with this yet to get any response and it’s leaving me stuck. Been able to make progress with the GIT  and other course but really stuck with the command line. Thanks

Whenever I use command line, I always use ‘pwd’ (which prints the working directory, i.e. informing me which file directory I am currently at). To get to the drama directory, you must first make sure that your current directory is at ‘movies’.( If not, using ‘cd …/’ will revert you one directory(cd …/…/ for reversing to two directories, and repeat the pattern for reversing further); until you are on the right directory.
When the result of your ‘pwd’ is ‘/home/ccuser/workspace/movies’, then you know you’re on the right directory(I mention this because changing directories (‘cd’) to a file while you are two or more files behind will result in an error. For example. typing cd biopic while you are in the workspace directory will result in an error)).
Then use ‘ls’. This should print out 4 different directories and 1 text file. One of which is ‘drama’.
Change directory to drama -> ‘cd drama’.
Then press ‘ls’. You should see two directories: ‘biopic’ and ‘historical’
Change directories to biopic -> ‘cd biopic’. Then press ‘ls -alt’ OR ‘ls’ (whichever allows you to pass(I’ve used ‘ls’ and it let me through)).
The next step is to type this: ‘cp frida.txt lincoln.txt’
This copies the frida.txt and Lincoln.txt to be placed in a different location as the instructions later shows.
Let me know if you have more questions.

So I’ve gone back and re-started the course page and there was some weird bug. If the instructions I’ve given you earlier does not work, then try this out.
From the very beginning, simply press ‘cd …/drama/biopic/’.
Remember when I mentioned to make sure that you are on the right directory before changing directories?(since you must append to a directory in a chain-like structure) Well I deliberately started at the biopic directory, and typed ‘cd …/drama/biopic’ as the instruction stated and it let me pass.
This shouldn’t have because my current directory was ‘/home/ccuser/workspace/movies/drama/biopic’. Pressing ‘cd …/drama/biopic’ is an incorrect input because doing so already places me again in the drama directory. The result did showed an error, but it did allow me to move on.
Basically, just press ‘cd …/drama/biopic/’ in the very first line and it should let you pass. However, I hope you understand why it shouldn’t have.

In terms of technique, command line is just a tree with many branches of directories and files. Picture an ascending and descending hierarchy of data. In able to move from one file to the next, you cannot skip a branch, therefore, you must append to the next directory until you reach the right file location. And I disagree, command line is much easier than html and css. I think you may be experiencing some bugs within the course itself as I mentioned in the previous post.

Sorry John.
That I keep disturbing you is just that I have encountered a lot of problem with the command line and it’s leaving me frustrated. Is there a different way of using the command line to navigate directory?

I realize that there is a “Report Bug” link on the course itself, but when I click the link it simply takes me back to the top of the instructions. Which could be a bug, or just my computer doing strange things.
Step seven of the ecosystem project instructs you to:

In one command, pipe the ls -l command to the head command. Then redirect the standard output of the head command to list1.txt.


Once you complete the above step, use cat to view the contents of list1.txt.

However, the hint is:

ls -la | head > list1.txt
cat list1.txt

Step eight of the instructions tell you to:

In one command, pipe the standard output of the ls -la command to the head command, then append the standard output to list1.txt, then pipe the standard output to the wc command.


Once you complete the above step, use cat to view the contents of list1.txt.

However, the hint is:

ls -l | head >> list1.txt | wc
cat list1.txt

Are the commands within the hints reversed or am I simply looking at it wrong?

I did the same as you - exactly! and the 3rd task is not turning green even though everything went right. So, I am unable to continue with the source command. I have got the clear terminal, but the next task not active. I changed the browser - the result is the same - the same point…

OK I found the problem - I typed in 11 instead of ll (I stopped in the middle yesterday :))

The point here is that in order to get past task 1 you need to start from the directory from the previous lesson. The lesson 8/10 will not let you start from any other directory to validate that you have changed into the appropriate directory. I had seen post where people were having this issue, and no one offered a solution to get past.

It’s very hard to make out what events you’re describing and what you’re asking. You talk about the response of a command which produces no output (because it’s redirected elsewhere) and you say the response is the same as the response? It’s even harder yet to guess what you think should have happened instead

Reset your code, start from the beginning.  An incorrect input in the beginning by accident may have messed it up a bit.

If you check out the man page for grep you’ll find that there is no -1 option
(here’s an online version, because you might find man a little arcane to use at first https://linux.die.net/man/1/grep)

So what I have learned from this activity is that I cannot spell Arctic and then that a 1 and a l (lower case ‘L’), look an aweful lot alike in command line.  So everything works fine, I need to pay close attention to the characters.  Thanks for all the help.

To move around in a file structure, you need to know where you are and where the files/directories that you are looking for are.

use pwd (print working directory) to find out where you are now
use ls to see what files and directories exist is the directory that you are in

Take a few minutes to learn what files/directories you are dealing with.
You have tried to move up one directory with this command:
$ cd drama/historical/ to drama/

Remember when we learned about using cd … to move up on directory?
Have another go at this and let us know how you got on.

Hi @webjumper21574,
When using the terminal, . refers to the current directory and .. is for the directory one level above the current. So, to go up 3 levels you’d run this:
$ cd ../../..

cding into /politics won’t work, since that would take you to the root of your file system and look for a directory called politics there, when you actually want to be looking in your home directory instead. However, the exercise wants you to use .. to change directories upwards, so you should do it the way I’ve shown you.

Those are commands to the editor, not text to be entered in the file
If your os/browser isn’t letting them through, you could try another editor

vim ~/.bash_profile

<do your editing as usual>
<press esc to leave insert mode>

They only live for that session, so the command has to be run for each session where you want to use it.

There is no code, sadly: after I type ‘nano hello.txt’ and press enter, the exercise never progresses.
Forever stuck here:




I’ve tried retyping it and hitting enter, I’ve tried closing the terminal and reopening it, I’ve tried entering other things to try to get it to give me a red X, and I’ve tried waiting. It does not seem to ever do anything but continue to circle. Any ideas?

Anyone have any info they could share with me on this? thanks a lot in advance and sorry i dont know how to use the forum first time using it.

You need to be in the drama directory, so,
cd ..

Now you can perform the file copy.

I am currently on page 6/11 of the Enviroment section (https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-the-command-line/lessons/environment/exercises/variables) but this problem persists across all lessons in this class.
<Below this line, describe in what way does your code behave incorrectly? Include ALL error messages.>
Nano (and other commands) seem to be completely missing from my terminal. I had no issues with it last night, but tonight, the command doesn’t work. Here is my output:

Yeah they broke the environment. Kind of impressive - even vi is gone and vi is almost always included, you probably have vi on your router and tv
You could… download it 
Some headers are missing to compile it yourself, but you could use debian’s nano package:
mkdir -p ~/nano
cd ~/nano
wget http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian/pool/main/n/nano/nano_2.2.6-3_amd64.deb
dpkg -x nano_2.2.6-3_amd64.deb .
echo 'PATH=$PATH:$HOME/nano/bin' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'export TERM=xterm' >> ~/.bashrc
cd $OLDPWD
source ~/.bashrc
nano  # good to go

That can be completely undone by removing the two lines I add in ~/.bashrc and removing ~/nano
But then again if you’re missing other commands as well that still might not get you far, for example, the exercise itself might be relying on various programs which could also be missing

I started the command line course today, and it’s missing for me as well. Everything worked except this. And I did the same as you, nano was missing.
Tried installing it following what ‘ionatan’ said, but stopped at the first echo line due to permission denied.
Please fix?

I have the same problem 
can any one help with this problem fast ???

I have the same problem at Enviroment 1/11. Kind of irritating screams inside. But it seems like this has only happened to us today so my best bet is that it will be fized in a few days. Fingers crossed. If you are bored make rubber ducky scripts. most of them use cmd or powershell. will be fun when you complete this.

My guess is that you were writing to /.bashrc instead of ~/.bashrc - you don’t have write permission in /
But since it looks like other things are also gone, there’s probably gonna be half a dozen other obstacles to overcome.
Oh and I’m able to run vi vim nano, perhaps it’s fixed now.

because these course teaches unix command line, not cmd. So some will work, but most simply won’t. If you want to use it for windows, learn cmd, or even better: powershell
Or use linux and learn bash, what this course is teaching

which software will i use in this command line exercise

you will use bash, which is the unix command line (and all its derivatives) but codecademy of course added some software so you use it on the codecademy website.

Is there a course to learn CMD OR PowerShell on codecademy.

There is no cmd or powershell course. If you have more questions, please make a new topic, this one is really old
I am sure you can find a course online which teaches one of both

Yes, I tried every possible way to get into this directory. No matter how I did it, the instruction did not get accepted.
Well, I already reported a bug, hopefully it gets fixed soon.

No clue.
Nano is a text editor, same as notepad or what have you. It behaves a whole lot the same, so compare your expectations to what you see and explain the difference in your  question.

i cant figure out what it is asking


This is the first thing that it is asking you to do:

Navigate to the 2014/dec/ directory.

Is that something that you are having trouble with?

I seem to do everything correctly, but it doesn’t move beyond this point.
Can someone help? Thanks

Just type cd(space)…/…/2014/dec
Notice there is only one space after cd command.

@fanta1 Yes it did work after typing just one space after cd. Thanks for your help.

You can’t “move on”? What do you mean? No space characters or no typing possible at all? Did you try a different browser? Got a scriptblocker that could prevent the terminal from working?
If you just don’t see any bash-tab you can click on the + sign in the terminal to open a new bash prompt.

I mean that I can’t go onto the next pages of the Command Line. Both the space characters and typing won’t make me move on the Command Line. I don’t have a scriptblocker that stops the terminal from working. I didn’t try a different browser.

Then I get the “Keep Trying/Get Code” box and click get code, but it won’t give me the code! What am I doing wrong? The only thing I notice is that the “1” in “-R1” that I type in looks different from the one “1” given in the task box. I can’t copy and paste either, so I need to know how to type it in.

That’s what I have been doing. How do you get your “1” to look like that in “grep -R1 Arctic”. It’s different from the “1” on my keyboard. I’m thinking that’s where the problem is coming from.

Just realized that’s the letter “L” and not number “1”. Thank God for YouTube lol.

Yeah, you’re right. That’s where the problem is coming from.It is the small letter L that might look like a 1 in this font.
When you type man grep and scroll through it, you will see that the option -l is just a short version and you could also use --files-with-matches. Also you will see there are no numbers being used as a first argument.

you really need to do cd ../drama/biopic, no other relative or absolute paths will get you through.

Can you explain why? Is it just a problem with the course or is it supposed to do something. After typing I got this:
bash: cd: ../drama/biopic/: No such file or directory 

It marked the box though.




 creazzycruisestudios:

Can you explain why?


because the exercise validates you input this exact command
Using this command means you do have to be in the right directory, .. means traveling up one directory, and then navigate to drama.

I cannot progress past this point. I’ve typed the command as it is indicated in the tutorial and nothing happens. I’ve refreshed and cleared my cache and I get the same result. I’ve searched the forums and have not seen a resolution that works. I think that this is a bug but not sure.

If you were able to write your command into bash and “nothing happened” then that sounds like you misinterpreted what you should do or what the result should be (because at that point you’re mostly interacting with very well tested programs that codecademy didn’t write)
If anyone’s to be able to figure out what you did differently or confirm whether there’s something wrong, then you’d have to explain what you did (in sufficient detail that they won’t for example interpret the exercise their way and therefore do something different from you)
If the exercise was about using echo, then perhaps you can look up a few examples about that command and how to use it.

I’m having the same issue as this person: Stuck in the Command Line: echo ""Hello""
However, I have tried the solutions that albionsrefuge has suggested and none of them work.
edit: Ok it appears that I got it to work. I had to capitalize the “H” in “Hello”. I think I did that at one point, but it works now… It’s case sensitive I guess.

alias only supports the format: name=replacement
what you wrote doesn’t match that (compare to what’s in the instructions) so no alias is created

Thanks for the reply, but still don’t see how my code doesn’t much. What should I have typed in line 2 instead?

Same as what is in the instructions. Compare.
can you tell the two versions part at all? If so they are different. I can tell them apart, so can you. You just need to look. There are about 10 characters to compare.

Ok ye I guess it was the spacing

That is correct.
But the exercise is more interested in what you typed than in what effect it had, the leading ./ throws it off simply because the author didn’t anticipate that

Would you recommend redoing the whole lesson so all the “variables” are reset?

“Welcome, Juris Puneiko” isn’t a valid bash command, it shouldn’t be in your .bash_profile and is reasonably likely to cause the test to fail
remove, comment out, or change to whatever it’s meant to be (a welcome message would typically be printed right, so there would need to be a command that writes out arguments given to it to achieve that effect)

how did i miss that? Thank you ionatan.
Besides removing this string, you can also echo it:
echo ""Welcome, Juris Puneiko""

now this string will show whenever .bash_profile is read

They use bash-bats which does set -e which has the effect of exiting on failed commands, I’m guessing that’s what’s going on
tnsaoehutnaohutn # error
echo hi # hi
set -e
aoeutnhaoeuaoht # error, bash exits
PS1="">> "" # not executed


can u help me a bit, my terminal wont load. and i cant progress because there is no terminal to write to

o.k. I try!!!  

You’re basically screwed.
If you really want to try to get through anyway you can:
try things like running your browser without extensions, running another browser, avoiding firewalls (tor-browser would let you avoid any that there may be)

i have tried internet explorer but it still wont load

That browser wasn’t fit for use even before it stopped being supported entirely. You should immediately stop using that (not kidding) and get firefox or chrome, or possibly edge which is sort of the product following IE but firefox/chrome are probably better supported than edge but I don’t really know that as fact. There’s also stuff like opera but… really you’re better off using something that web developers are interested in supporting and that’s firefox/chrome

chrome isnt working either


cf26530e2983e1eb656f8eaf67c832c2582346cc.png1358×619
 it wont load as you can see ( in chrome )

I suggested more things which you haven’t exhausted. I’ve got no more suggestions beyond those.

If a relatively clean chrome install isn’t working, then most likely it’s an issue with the connection, something isn’t getting through (keep in mind there are computers between you and them, something could be blocking something) the most likely way around that is tor-browser, other browsers are unlikely to make a difference so running through those suggestions is kind of pointless.

I am using a Mac so I don’t have ctrl and command O doesn’t work

Mac’s have control, don’t they?
You could use vim instead of nano, if you’re unfamiliar with vim, here are the absolute basics:

press i to enter Insert mode.
in insert mode you can edit text like in a “normal” editor

esc to leave insert mode
type :wq  for Write and Quit, followed by Enter



Just to confirm, control +  O works just fine in nano on my MacBook.

I’m going to be getting a Mac soon. Is there a lot of compatibility issues with coding, or will I be fine?

From what I understand you won’t have access to an official repository like those of major linux distros.
Other than that and not exactly being FOSS, things look pretty and if it’s a laptop then Mac is where battery life is at
It’s unix-like, so it should be more comfortable than windows.
trade-offs.

Sounds good. I’m excited to finally rid myself of these ever worsening Windows updates…

What’s so bad about windows updates that isn’t present in a mac? :o

Nothing other than personal preference. I was in love with windows 7 and the entire aero theme, then things started getting weird for me and I just don’t like the feel of windows anymore.
The look and sleekness of os x and the mac itself just makes me feel good inside, if that makes sense, haha.

It’s not the same though. And grep can’t correct you because it would have to change the meaning of what you told it (not to mention it can’t know what you meant)

navigation is done with cd, if you need help with a command you can do: man cd
if you need more help, improve the question (include more details like error, a actually question and so on)

I have a question about that, I tried cd …/historical/ and a few variations on that, can you help me make sense of the of whats going on here?

can you include a screenshot of your attempt, including the following commands:
ls 
pwd 
the cd command at which you attempt the navigation

Well the correct command is ‘ls’. Can you link the exercise because it could be showing you what happens when you use a command that doesn’t exist.

The instructions say [quote]
In the terminal, after the $ type:


ls


and press Enter. Be sure to type the letter l as in “lemon” and not the number 1.

I’m assuming you were using a capital L, but it’s lowercase.

did you see this topic? it has a number of suggestions, one of them should work

Yes, I have seen it. I tried the “alt gr combinations” and the screenplay keyboard, but none of them worked. Is there any way to continue the course without doing this exercise? Thank you!

did you try option 1 and 4 as well? 5 can always be used, if it is really not working
you used alt gr? you should have used alt (alt gr won’t work)

I’ve got a work-around that generates it on the remote machine, it takes a few steps that need to be carried out exactly:
Enter this:
EDITOR=vim

Then hold down Ctrl while pressing X and then E
press i
press Ctrl K
press !
press !
press ESC key
press :
press w
press q
press Enter key
You’ll now be back at the shell with an error message saying | isn’t a valid command
press up-arrow
Pressing up goes up in history, what all the previous did was to create | as a line in history, and now you can go back to it.

Another alternative is:
printf '\174\n' >> /home/ccuser/.bash_history
history -n

And then pressing up key
(but hey, the previous version uses my main text editor so I gotta be partial to that :P)
174 is the ascii value for | written in octal (base 8)
I obtained it like this:
python -c 'print(""{:o}"".format(ord(""|"")))'

Where the vertical bar can be switched out for any other character, but obviously you would need another machine to run that on, for example if you have python istalled then you can run just the print part of that

Also, note that in the title of this thread, you used ` instead of ’
Those are two different characters, both are used differently in programming languages and you gotta tell those apart

Now, type the pwd command and copy paste your results too, please.

Assuming that your commands were successful, the next likely explanation is that it was looking for cd ../feb to have been typed (like in their example). If so, navigate into any of 2015’s children (including feb) and run that from there

So, the correct line is $cd…/feb
??

Thanks, that seemed to work.
I indeed had to type “cd …/feb”

Okay, now I’m having trouble on the next step. It says I have it right, but it doesn’t show a new directory “media/”


f410460a0df64e48a3c83e17574d6871883ed844.png1320×676

Is it supposed to look like that? Because it does not show the new directory, as it says it should in the instructions.

Why would it? You changed directory
If it’s difficult or even just annoying to keep track of the current directory, you can put it in the prompt by doing:
PS1=""\\W $ ""
(to make persistent that line would need to be added in ~/.bashrc

Okay. Thanks

Hello,
ls lists all of the parent directories. Above these directories, there is one root directory.
Question: What is the command line if I’d like to know the parent directory?
Thank you very much.

@arhammeister,
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8426058/bash-get-the-parent-directory-of-current-directory
####========== a bit of info ==============================
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cd_(command)
cd by itself or cd ~ will always put you in your home directory.
cd . will leave you in the same directory you are currently in (i.e. your current directory won’t change)
cd ~username will put you in username’s home directory.
cd dir (without a /) will put you in a subdirectory. for example, if you are in /usr, typing cd bin will put you in /usr/bin, while cd /bin puts you in /bin.
cd … will move you up one directory.
So, if you are /usr/bin/tmp, cd … moves you to /usr/bin, while cd …/… moves you to /usr (i.e. up two levels).
You can use this indirection to access subdirectories too. So, from /usr/bin/tmp, you can use cd …/…/local to go to /usr/local.
cd - will switch you to the previous directory (UNIX only).
For example, if you are in /usr/bin/tmp, and go to /etc., you can type cd - to go back to /usr/bin/tmp.
You can use this to toggle back and forth between two directories.
cd is frequently included built directly into a command-line interpreter.
This is the case in most of the Unix shells (Bourne shell, tcsh, bash, etc.), cmd.exe and Windows PowerShell on Windows and COMMAND.COM on DOS.

Thank you very much for the reply. Here is a copy of output after typing “pwd”:

Start  with pwd to see what directory you are currently in, or ls to see what contents are present in the current directory. That will give you some idea which way to navigate.

Good question.
Let’s analyze this a bit:


> “redirect”: this is used to redirect output from a common to a file on disk, overwriting anything that may have been already in the file.

>> “appending redirect”: same as redirect, but instead it appends rather than overwrites.

< “read”: read a file for input to a command

| “pipe”: pass the output of a command to another command for further processing

tee “tee”: used with | to simultaneously redirect and pipe.

With this information, are you able to see the different?

| is to pass onto another command.

Yah, this helps, thanks  Although I don’t think we were introduced to the tee, but that’s ok. I guess we can look up extra info on that. Thanks!

Which white line? The one where you’re asked for a file name? You’re supposed to enter a file name or leave the suggested filename as it is and press enter. After that you can exit with Ctrl X as suggested at the bottom of nano’s interface and in the instructions
Do you mean that this is the cursor?
 



If so I’d say that’s the “terminal” misbehaving, I’d just try opening a new terminal and continuing from there without opening nano, that’s not normal behaviour for nano and might not be nano’s fault at all
You could try ctrl C, ctrl L, ctrl Z and see if those have any effect (interrupt, redraw, and suspend respectively) but I wouldn’t really count on it - again, if you can just get around it by starting a new terminal, that seems like the way to go
If you still need to create the file then that can be done by other means, for example:
$ echo echo ""Welcome, Jane Doe"" > .bash_profile

You could also use another editor called vi, it’s a little more difficult to use, you’d do:
start it with the command vi .bash_profile
Then press i
which enters insert-mode
type the text
hit esc
write:
:wq
which saves and exits
Another way to save and exit is to type: ZZ (shift + z, twice)
after hitting esc




 ionatan:

echo echo “Welcome, Jane Doe” > .bash_profile


Thank you so much 

That’ll actually drop the quotes, it should have been
echo echo \""Welcome, Jane Doe\"" > .bash_profile

But I guess they might not check that anyway
The content of the file can be viewed with:
cat .bash_profile

to navigate you need to change directory, as you have been taught, this is done with the cd command (take a guess of what cd is abbreviation?)
to change to a specific directory do: cd directoryname
where directoryname is the name of the directory

i’m stuck on this also…HELP!!!

Hi, @netslayer29565 and @netninja81409  you need to be more specific on your question, so that you can actually get helpped.  What exactly doesn’t work ?
If it’s only to navigate to the comedy folder : you need the command cd, but it will change according to where you are on the path. Check the configuration of the paths here.
Some examples (check in which folder you are with pwd) :
# FIRST EXAMPLE : you are in the movies folder
$ pwd
/home/ccuser/workspace/movies   # movies folder

# go just one step down to reach for the comedy folder
$ cd comedy/    # change folder
$ pwd   # check if you've changed to comedy folder
/home/ccuser/workspace/movies/comedy  # ok

# SECOND EXAMPLE:  now let's say you are in the drama repository
$ pwd
/home/ccuser/workspace/movies/drama
$ cd ../  # go up (back to movies folder)
$ pwd
/home/ccuser/workspace/movies  # ok
$ cd comedy/ # and down to comedy : 
$ pwd
/home/ccuser/workspace/movies/comedy

# you could have done all that in one single command : 
$ pwd
/home/ccuser/workspace/movies/drama
$ cd ../comedy 
$ pwd
/home/ccuser/workspace/movies/comedy # ok

The …/ means that you go up (again, check the configuration of the paths).
Hope this will help.

Hi I too am stuck on this exercise, it is asking you to navigate to comedy/ using ls.

It’s probably because you used cd ./historical and ls -l which while correct, are a little long-winded and not exactly what the instructions are asking for. Try using the simpler cd historical and ls commands instead.

it’s working

Here’s a breakdown of the commands used in that lesson:
pwd = Print Working Directory.  This prints out the directory the console is currently in.  In this case, /home/ccuser/workspace/blog.
ls = Lists the files inside the ‘working directory’ or the directory the console is currently in.  In this case, 2014, 2015, hardware.txt are the files.
cd = Navigates into the defined directory.  In this case, the 2015 directory, or folder.  So, the new directory it is in is: /home/ccuser/workspace/blog.
This lesson asks you first to print the working directory (pwd), then list it’s contents (ls), then navigate to the 2015 directory within it (cd), then print the new working directory (pwd), and finally list THAT directory’s content (ls).
Hope this helps.

Yes that helped. Thank you

1.To access the command line, we use a terminal emulator, often just called the terminal.
In the terminal, after the $ type:

ls

and press Enter. Be sure to type the letter l as in

You should see three items print out below the command. Click Next to learn how this command works.

That is an elle ess as in lowercase, LS.

ok so i solved the problem. If bash isnt left at the exact previous point from the past lesson, navigating to the appropriate folder wont let you proceed. What the lesson doesnt really indicate is that you are stepping back a folder and stepping into another folder within the command.

 lego999:

im doing what it says


Is this the step that you are stuck on:
Navigate to the comedy/ directory

Show me what you are doing and what the terminal is responding with.
Don’t forget that you can use:

pwd to see what directory you are in now
ls to see what is in that directory


yes i am stuck on that part and it keeps just not giving me the check…its weird i think its bugged or something 

Show me what you are seeing.
Do a pwd and an ls and then try changing directories.

i haven’t done a pwd yet…




 lego999:

i haven’t done a pwd yet…


I can wait … take your time

ok so i tryed using a pwd but it just said '/home/ccuser/workspace/movies

Okay, so that told you that you are in the movies directory.
Now, when you do an ls, what does it tell you is in that movies directory?

it just says '/home/ccuser/workspace/movies no matter waht i do with the pwd 

pwd is telling you the name of the directory that you are in right now – it isn’t going to change until you change directories 

ok   i didn’t know that

When you do an ls – what does the ls command tell you is in that movies directory?

lets see uhh what? 

Is this what you see when you do these same commands?
 pwd                                                                                                                 
/home/ccuser/workspace/movies                                                                                         
 ls
action  comedy  drama  genres.txt
$

yeah!!! It Does!!!

Great, so you know:

You are in the movies directory
The movies directory contains a directory named comedy (among other things)

Now you need to use the cd command (change directory) to get to that comedy directory.
Did you want to give that a go?

ok got it 1 second!!!

it worked! thank you so much!!!

When you're typing a lot in a terminal and want to clear the screen quickly, you can do so easily a couple different ways.

The one most people know...







I too faced the same issue.
I solved like thi ,
1.Copy and paste the filename from the instructions.
2.then do remaining instructions.you are done

I just attempted this but I am still not able to exit out of nano and receive a check mark
I typed and tried to copy/paste
“Hello, I am nano.”
“Ctrl + O”
“Ctrl + X”
“clear”
and still nothing

Did you type the word “echo” before “Hello”
To me ages to realise I had completely missed the command echo

I did that but I still cannot get through this stage

There is a big problem with the question. I have been able to do the first question but have tried countless times trying to do No.2. It keeps on having the error message of: “Type the command after the shell prompt” and that is very confusing because how could I possibly type the command before the command prompt?!

flags are case sensitive, it should be Rl not RL

I was already doing grep -RL Arctic /home/ccuser/workspace/geography in the first place 

Oh ■■■■ that is really sensitive! I was doing -RL with a capital L and not -Rl with a
lowercase! XD  Thanks!

Yea, really case sensitive. You sometimes  have a lowercase and uppercase flag, for example usermod has a -l and a -L flag.

i thought that was a 1. they legit look exactly the same in that font

535,"Stuck in the Command Line: echo ""Hello""","Get Help,Command Line",,12,"
I’ve been stuck at the that point where I should type echo “Hello” (after the prompt):
I type, as it says, after the prompt:  $echo Hello (without the quotes “”, because the codecademy’s terminal isn’t showing, or is not accepting my keybord’s commands to the quotation marks "" "" as I type. I mean, I’ve been trying to type them, however, they don’t appear on the Codecademy terminal).
That bug is happening only in the Commad Line course. I haven’t had such a problem with the other courses I’ve been attending here on Codecademy.
I’ve tried to type:  echo “Hello” (after the prompt), but it shows: echo Hello (which seems to be ok, due to the fact the word Hello apears on the following line of the terminal as if it had been echoed. The problem is the error message that blocks me from moving forward to the next exercise.

@g4lvy,
Which Browser and Operating system are you using…???

I’m using Firefox (version: 44.0) and my OS is Mac OS X (10.7.5) Lion.
I’ve also tried using Chrome, but it happens the same!
PS.: I’ve tried typing both quotes: “” and ’  ’ . But, none of them appeared on the console only in the Commad Line Course.

Yes, I’ve tried to Copy/ Cut & Paste the statement. The exercise or the page or the page’s terminal doesn’t allow me to Paste what I’ve Copied/ Cut, the option “Paste” is not available in the Edit menu bar.
I typed the command echo “Hello” on the bug’s repport text box to check if it would have the same bug, but, it was ok and accepted the quotations, though.
I also did what you said and typed that commad. Then I tried to Copy & Paste, but couldn’t do it.

@albionsrefuge
Hey! Nice one!
I could get it through ONLY with the Option 3: Use the on-screen keyboard. Actually, it worked only using the on-screen Characters Viewer and double clicking on the quotation marks!
I’ve already tried to type the quotation marks on the following exercise, but, with no success as the previous one.
However, I can cope with using the on-screen Characters Viewer for the ones with such a characters problem.
I appreciate your support! thank you!

If you search for the substring “atnuhaoehutnhaotnuhtnaouhtna” then you’ll get 0 results. Does that mean grep isn’t working? I call that working very well, because there are 0 matches, so printing them all means producing exactly no output.
To get a result you can add that substring to one of the files, or perhaps search for something that is in the files.

that makes no sense.

Letter case (upper/lower) is a big deal with terminal. Try typing export and not Export.

good suggestion though, will keep that in mind as a try to find solution

Dumb question, but are you closing/saving the file in nano before clearing the screen?

that’s, a good question, I actually have been and I had kept attempting to recreate the profile so many times I actually went back and used rm command to eliminate the extra ones I had made in the directory. You think that could have something to do with my issue as well?

cause there were like a ton lol

It could be. Try resetting the lesson if you can.

alright, I reset this exercise (hoping that’s the same as resetting the whole lesson if its not how do I reset whole lesson lol) will update with results following this post

^^ the above worked, however not by just resetting that lesson, had to go back to exercise 1 and restart each lesson as I went through it, and by the time I got back to screen 6/11 the coding/check mark validation worked.
Thanks man

“didn’t work” doesn’t explain what happened, instead of pasting instructions, tell us what you did, what you expected to happen and what happened!

You don’t have to help if you don’t know how. You also don’t have to come up with excuses for why you’re not able to help. Someone else could so thanks. ionatan

Nobody can help if you do not explain what the problem is.
So for your own sake and for everyone that might consider helping out. Make it easy to do so. It gets you answers and nobody has to waste time guessing what information you need.
Being rude doesn’t help your cause either I might add.
To solve a problem you have to figure out what the problem is. Since you did not, that’s what I’m asking for. It’s not an excuse for not knowing, it’s explaining to you what information your question is missing.

You need use ctrl under enter, than it will be work. 

For me, I had to make sure I was “in” the Nano environment on a Mac.  Otherwise, I was trying to open a file in Chrome.  Could this help?

Thanks, for me this solved my problem too!

You’ll have to consider what you were meant to do and whether you did that something.
Did you misspell the file name? You seem to have done that in your post at least. Tab-completion is a useful tool in the command-line, both for avoiding typos and checking if what you typed so far was correct
If you were meant to create/update a particular file with touch, then you can check whether the file exists after doing so with ls and you would also need to consider if you’re in the right directory with pwd

Do I have two batman.txt files? Or just one?

There are a lot of errors in the Command Line course, both in the lesson text and how the tasks respond to what is input. I can progress fine, but I know these issues will confuse many people.
The task completion seems to check for the right command somewhere in the terminal, even if it was several lines back, this leads to lots of unneeded error messages when the task jump ahead of where you actually are in the lesson. There also seems to be some directory issues where the task completion requirement does not match with what is actually required to progress in the task.
Also, I think it would be beneficial to make it obvious that this is for Unix based systems and only some commands will work in Windows.

You moved away from the original directory (look at your commands) so unless there’s a drama/biopic there as well, then you’ll get told that there isn’t

If there isnt one, then why does the instructions tell me there is?

They don’t. You changed your location and that is a relative path, relative to your position, so if you change position, then the location that the relative path refers to also changes.
In a graphical file explorer, if you’re told to double-click the GAMES directory, but you first navigate into your empty PICTURES directory, do you still expect to find GAMES in there as well?
The difference is that you have to request the information, but you still need the same information, can carry out the same actions, and so on (actually you can do a whole lot more because you’re not limited to what the buttons happen to be doing)

Please post a link to the exercise and the command you have tried.

i all so need help
i try every thaing that i can think.

Then you also would need to explain what you’re trying to do and what’s preventing you.

I too am having the same problem. I have followed the instructions in the exercise, even going through them multiple times and I’m not getting the check mark in the box for step 2.
In step 1 it says:
In the terminal, type
nano ~/.bash_profile
Done
Step 2 says:
In ~/.bash_profile, at the top of the file, type
echo “Welcome, Jane Doe”
You can use your name in place of “Jane Doe”.
Type Ctrl + O to save the file.
Press Enter to write the filename.
Type Ctrl + X to exit.
Finally, type clear to clear the terminal window.
I did all that including using my own name instead of “Jane Doe”. I even tried it with “Jane Doe”, and step 3 wont light up.

I found the answer. In step 2 the instructions say type “echo “Welcome, Jane Doe””. I had forgot to type “echo” in the command.
Hope that helps others.

Hi everyone,
Currently I’m stuck on Nano. My problem is two fold: first I’m having trouble understanding the purpose for Nano within the Linux/unix command/shell environment?
Also I can’t get overcome Nano 2-6, it’s the one where you add alias hy=“history”
what should I do?
","
Are you talking about the bash on codecademy?

Yes: ~/.bash_profile?

Nano is a text editor, incredibly useful, particularly in an environment where settings are usually stored in text files. Vim and Emacs are far more powerful but it’s rather difficult for a beginner to figure out how to do just about anything in either of them.
Many commands come with a manual page which you can access with the man command, for example:
$ man man

That step is to add a line to a text file, a very basic task, don’t you agree? What’s stopping you?
Whatever is stopping you is probably something that you can ask about or google.
There are definitely lots of tutorials and what not on how to edit a text file, and they are a search query away from you.

Instead do this

You could install a program named touch and make sure it’s in your PATH, that’s not really any different.
On this machine (fedora 24), touch is located at /usr/bin/touch, that is what gets executed when I type touch in a terminal.
The machines that you interact with in the course run gnu/linux, the course teaches bash and some other utilities commonly found on unix-like machines, and yes, mac a unix-like system, and windows is not
What you’d do to get a similar environment is to install a virtual machine with just about any linux distro (they use largely the same things, with different philosophies about what to include and how fast to change to newer software)
The creators of the utilities you’re using in the course have some opinions on mac:
https://www.gnu.org/proprietary/malware-apple.en.html
So while most of the course applies to mac… they are still very different

So this mean that Codecademy is teaching about a language that mostly Mac or Linex can be used, but not Windows? I am a bit confuse…

Cygwin is a distribution that contains ports of common gnu utilities to windows, so it’s not that you can’t use it.
The majority of server software runs on gnu/linux. A large problem with windows and mac is that they come with licenses that restrict your freedom. Their code is secret and doesn’t necessarily serve you, it serves large companies, you come second.
What do you prefer, an os developed in secrecy designed to sell, or one where everyone’s free to inspect and suggest changes, and the goal is to create useful tools?
A lot of people are willing to compromise just because everyone else does. Shiny things sell. And windows/mac are markets.

Hey t_kilvertkelvinhall_,
I got through this exercise with the following:
Step 1: type (w/o the "" "" 's): nano ~/.bash_profile
Step 2: In nano, type: alias pd=“pwd”
2A: Hit ‘Control - O’ (the letter)
2B: Hit ‘Enter’

Step 3: Type in 'source ~/.bash_profile

The above steps are perfectly right. Ensure that the nano editor is blank with only alias pd=“pwd” typed in it. In case anything else exists, remove it and proceed it should work. Worked for me. Or follow the steps after resetting the exercise.

lakes.txt is indeed not a command and bash tells you so. Did you expect something else to happen? If so what?
Also, is the ""-""-character at the end of your first command supposed to have some effect? Why is it there?

did u follow the instruction? it state there need to put “-” in the command line.

https://www.codecademy.com/en/courses/learn-the-command-line/lessons/redirection/exercises/pipes
Do you mean this?
cat lakes.txt | sort > sorted-lakes.txt
That’s part of the file name.
As it so happens it is allowed, from sort's manpage:
       With no FILE, or when FILE is -, read standard input.

But it’s optional, and I think it should rather be written in this order:
cat lakes.txt | sort - > sorted
But since reading from stdin is common behaviour for that kind of command, I find it a bit peculiar to add it, it might be there for compatibility or something like that.
But better yet is to write:
sort lakes.txt > sorted

You can use your name in place of “Jane Doe”.

It won’t let me do anything past typing past - echo “Welcome, Jane Doe” -

Type Ctrl + O to save the file.


What they really mean here is press and hold Ctrl and press the letter o key.  That should save your file.

When I go to type “clear” it doesn’t do anything.

Let’s see a screenshot of your whole web browser just after you’ve typed clear.

I know what youre doing wrong dude, theres no space between  “~/ and .bash_profile”
wrong way = ~/ .bash_profile
right way   = ~/.bash_profile

Got a screenshot showing that?
If cp failed then it’ll give you some form of feedback.
How does one reproduce what you describe?
If you’ve aliased cp to something else, or otherwise have hidden it, then that could explain misbehaviour. The following command should be saying that cp is a built-in bash command:
$ type cp

No feedback, there just isnt a copy. But the Instruction Box on the left side becomes checked when I do it.

Can you take me through the process of what keys you’re pressing, or what you’re typing at each step? That can help to identify the problem

Ctrl O

ive already done it a good 3 times

and ive tried reseting the file just to try again and when i did the program recognise USER “Jane Doe” but the box didnt get checked

Are you typing this in first before doing anything else? nano ~/.bash_profile
then type in the first line and continue to do everything else
(make sure you spell things right also)

yeah, ive done that
maybe its a bug?

echo “Welcome, Jane Doe”
alias pd=“pwd”
alias hy=“history”
alias ll=“ls -la”
export USER= “Jane Doe”
this is what comes up

Shouldn’t be, try to refresh using either (f5 or ctrl + f5)  you will have to re-try it again after. If not im not sure whats causing it.
@stetim94 anything I’ve missed ?

alright, thanks.
i think ill just try it again later and see if it works then.

I had the same problem. Many attempts later I deleted all previous Nano edits and removed space ""USER=“JaneDo” and it worked

What’s the problem? You posted a bunch of commands and their output but you aren’t explaining what you need help with! A good way of doing this is to ask a bunch of specific questions. Right now it’s difficult to guess what you want to know.

I navigated to the biopic directory and typed in cp frida.txt per the instructions. I recieved this error
cp: missing destination file operand after ‘frida.txt’
Try ‘cp --help’ for more information.
I typed in  lincoln.txt  as well and recieved this error
bash: lincoln.txt: command not found
Thank you

Hello.  Can anyone help?




 brianh9:

cp: missing destination file operand after ‘frida.txt’


That error message is telling you that you left out the information about where you want frida.txt copied to.
Do you understand what step 2 of that lesson is asking you to do?  If you understand that then it will make it easier to use the right command.

Gotta explain what you want to know or people would have to guess and they (I) may not be willing to. Being clear and direct greatly affects response time, quality of response, and chance of getting one at all!
If I just read “this is what i did”, then I get a little confused and then move along, because nothing was asked.

If it’s only asking you to output the file’s content, then you probably shouldn’t also be sorting it? You’re writing to files as well, and you’re not reading the file that they ask you to display. You are trying to execute uniq-deserts.txt but it is probably not marked as executable and probably doesn’t contain something that bash knows how to execute

You should check on that again, make sure it isn’t asking for “Hello” instead.

That will depend on your operating system. What are you using?

 codemonster835:

window 7


Windows 7 has an app called Snipping Tool, just click on the Start button and slowly start typing Snip – you should see it appear in the list

Alright, just to clear out any confusion on the code checker’s part, look under the Get Help button and take the option to reset this exercise.
When that is done, make sure you type only
echo ""Hello""

Don’t forget to make the H on Hello uppercase.

omg wow so i was doing it right its just that i didn’t put a uppercase H for hello…
but thank you so much for the help bro 

hey dude so i found how to do it. just make sure you type in hello with the capital H instead of a lower case so it should look like echo “Hello”

okay thanks dude.

Ive already checked Q&A forum before jst not come to any conclusion, I said i “guess” not certainly or something
if you know the true codes say it please since some people need it
thanks in advance

just stuck on step 2 and dont know what to do else .you can see my codes in image but i cant pass this step




 miladzxc:

i guess thats just another bug


This is the sort of bug that you will spend plenty of your time fixing as you learn to watch for details.
There isn’t a lot of code there to hide it in but since you are stuck, I’ll give you the hint that you should check on how you’ve used quotation marks.

thank you for your advice or hint however as i said i was right , i even check the spaces as well
dont know why but i passed the exercise by Chrome , not working on Mozila at all…

omg i didnt see that double quotation
but i did this exercise several times
in the screenshot i jst typed quotation mark two times but other times i printed it true im sure

if you dont believe me you can jst see other topics about exactly this step of the exercise “bash profile” 

Other people asking similar things can just as well be an indication of that they too made mistakes. You’re spending energy on the claim that you did it right instead of looking for what might be wrong. People make mistakes. I make mistakes all the time. We fix them and learn from them.

Ahaha  i got your point man thanks: but that was just a very simple code ! I was totally sure
are you ok with this title : Am i doing any mistake or just a BUG? ?

    In exercise 5, doing cat < lakes.txt and doing cat lakes.txt do the same thing. 

am I missing something here, or are they meant to do the same thing?
  


I have the same question as the one seen in the above post. However, the answer there does not make sense to me. Could someone please explain. Thanks!
","
if i understand it right, cat filename.txt will read the file. if you use < no file is specified. so cat will read the standard input (stdin), which is provided by <.
in the end the difference is minimal in this scenario.

The manual page I copied that answer from is clear. It concatenates files or from standard input if no files are provided. That’s what it says, go back and read it! You can also bring that text up yourself with $ man cat,  and indeed that is also one of the first places to look up information about a command, something you must do a lot as you can’t just know it all.

Once inside the file, as your second screenshot demonstrates, you write the echo command.  From there use Ctrl+O to save the file, and after typing the file name, press Enter.  It may prompt you with a Y/N question, just type Y.  Once done, press Ctrl+X, which closes the file.  Now you’re back in the command line, and no longer inside your file.  Type clear, to clear the file, then run the file with the line it tells you in step 3.

The file that you should modify is ~/.bash_profile, not ~/.bash_profileHarry

I’m not really understanding the way the pipe works or how it’s being used by redirecting the outputs and inputs. (also first time posting if i did something wrong sorry)
","
Programs communicate by reading and writing text. | is used to send the output of one into another. Similarly, > sends to file and < reads from file
the | cat part is redundant, can send wc's output directly to the file, cat is just repeating it there.
This is equivalent:
wc < volcanoes.txt > islands.txt


I was wondering pretty much the same thing richt now, all the “cat” is a bit confusing here.
Would it work if we just did it like this:

Typing ls should be all you need to do. I ran into some issues with some of the exercise’s where it wouldn’t recognize what I was doing, but resetting the exercise typically fixed it. You can reset it by click Get Help in the lower right corner and then clicking “I want to restart this exercise”.

If you got this far and managed to escape learning how to do that, then what else did you miss? Start over from square one.
What’s stopping you from asking the exact same thing in google’s search box?
You will need to find things out constantly, you can’t ask about every little thing, learn to find them yourself instead.
It’s perfectly fine to ask about anything you don’t know how to approach. It’s perfectly fine to ask about how to find information yourself. It’s not fine to ask about the first thing taught to you, because then you show that you aren’t paying attention and there’s some much greater problem going on and if you have to ask this then you will have to ask about everything else as well.

I’m not sure about that, I think it might be fussy about how you do your navigating – it isn’t expecting you to put the whole path in like that.

I completed the Command Line Lessons. How do I leverage this on a resume?
Currently, I just have the word Linux on my resume, but I feel as though that is not nearly as impressive as it could be. How would I put it on a resume and use it to improve my chances of getting hired.
This may not be the best place to post this, but it is a start.

guys,how can i put “/” in the exercises of command line?
","
Im not sure what you mean by “/” but if you want to browse through directories you can just do
cd dir

where dir is where you want to go… Also if you want to go back one you can just do…
cd ../previousDir

Im not sure this was what you wanted, but i hope this is usefull…

no,in the exercise 5 of command line,how can i put “cd jan/memory/”?

Just type in the terminal
cd 2015/jan/memory/

Basically going through the 2015 directory then january directory, then the memory of jan

i can’t type “/”!
this is the problem

What is stopping you? Finding the key? Nothing showing up? If nothing shows up, do other keys show up? Can you type it in other applications?
See how that information is required to figure out what’s wrong? You have do describe the problem a little more if others are to know the same things that you know about it.
Your OS has a clipboard feature that you can use to copy text with if nothing else.
There is probably also some on-screen keyboard that you can use.

i’m using windows,not OS

Lol you cant type “/”?? Thats litterarly after the > sign… Just do Ctrl + the question mark key…
Os Btw is a Operating System. And Yes, Windows is an Operating System…

OS is short for Operative System. Windows has copy and paste as well, and on-screen keyboard. What about the rest of my questions?




 digitalcoder20607:

how can i put “/” in the exercises


I’ve never had anyone report that they couldn’t type / before, but if you want to try the alt + code method here: My keyboard does not allow me to type a character used in a Codecademy lesson. What should I do? then the code for / is 47.

how does he not know where the / is if he wrote it in his question? 




 yeahdan:

how does he not know where the / is


It isn’t a matter of not knowing where the key is, it is a matter of the key not working in the terminal. At least that is one scenario – we’ll have to wait until we hear back to be sure.

Oh, OK! Sorry I didn’t understand. Thanks for clarifying though!

Hello, im having the same problem. Already tryed copy and paste, a different browser, alt + 47, but it doesnt work at all. So, any clues of what i should do now?




 leila:

any clues of what i should do now?


I don’t have any further clues but I am interested in what sort of computer/OS you are using that is displaying this behaviour.

what is the use of / in command?
sometimes in the instructions they say jan/media/ and refer as media…i mean can we use cd jan/media instead of cd jan/media/?




 andyahkmenrah:

can we use cd jan/media instead of cd jan/media/?


Yes you can.
You will find that if you use the tab key to auto-complete your directory names that it will put the / in for you.

Seems like the kind of question that would be easy to find an answer to by using a search engine. Looking things like this up is something one might sometimes do every few minutes at times, so if you’re having trouble doing that then you should definitely be asking about that instead so that you can find this information yourself.

Figure out you current directory using pwd. Then navigate to action/ using cd. For example, if you’re in movies/comedy/, first go up a directory using cd …/ and that should put you in movies/. Then change directories to the desired directory, in this case, cd action/ which should do the job.

bash will print the content of that variable each time it’s asking for input from the user.

What you need to do is to find out where you are and where the other directory is.
How can you find that information?
And then, based on that information, you can determine how you need to move to get to the right location.

The exercise is pretty fussy. It wants you to get there using exactly:

You almost did that right, but you added a space in yours that broke the path.

Help from this post: My keyboard does not allow me to type a character used in a Codecademy lesson. What should I do?
However even when I use OPTION 3, the greater than sign (>) doesn’t show up on the interface. Anyone has an idea?

Pasting it in? Changing browser?
Otherwise you can probably write a script that adds it to your .bash_history, then reload history from file and press UP
Completely ridiculous work-around but hey…
$ python -c ""open('$HOME/.bash_history', 'a').write(chr(62) + '\n')""
$ history -r

less-than is has an ascii value of 60 if you need that as well

I tried pasting it and changing browser, it didn’t work.
I will try the solution you’re offering soon, just need to figure out how since it’s way more advanced than where I am right now with coding haha. But thanks a lot for taking the time and for the tip!

You’d just copy those two lines into bash ($ at the start is to say it’s to be entered into bash)
You don’t really need to know anything to do that.
Another way of going about it is to upload a text file with those characters, download it and replace your history file.
For example I made one here: https://paste.debian.net/plain/781637
To download it and overwrite your .bash_history:
$ wget https://paste.debian.net/plain/781637
$ mv 781637 ~/.bash_history
$ history -r

Appending to your history would be preferable but >> is used to do that… There’s probably a way around that too but your history is probably not of any value anyway.

Hi thanks a lot for your tips. I was away for a couple of days which is why I only answer now.
So I tried writing the script to type > into bash and here is what the output was:

This was in the Learn Git lesson, and I encountered the same issue as in the command line.

Okay I finally understand what you meant by adding it to the .bash_history. Although I had fully everything single character because the bash doesn’t let me paste anything in it, now when I press UP I have both < and > signs stored. THANKS SO MUCH. I was ready to pull my hair out.
I have to say though that it is indeed completely ridiculous to go to such length to be able to type a single character into the interface, something definitely needs to be done.
Anyway thanks a lot man!

New update: turns out my keyboard was in Canadian French mode (I got my laptop in Montreal), just changed it to US and amazingly all the characters worked as I typed them. Sigh.

The irony now is that with the US keyboard it doesn’t let me type the "" "" so what I end up doing is to go back and forth between the US and Canadian keyboards.

can i just delete the alias or other commands in the ~/.bash_profile and do source ~/.bash_profile if i want to delete a alias or a command in the bash_profile??


pls help
thank you!
","
First off, I believe that aliases and most other configuration belongs in ~/.bashrc.
My .bash_profiles on various machines all look something like this:
[[ -f ~/.bashrc ]] && . ~/.bashrc

All that does is to source my ~/.bashrc if it exists, so that all my shell configurations always run, with the exception of for non-interactive shells (like file syncing over network)
The first line of my .bashrc is:
# If not running interactively, don't do anything
[[ $- != *i* ]] && return

And then follow everything else, such as aliases.
There is no way to reset what commands were run, you would instead run a new shell. If you have then removed commands from your .bashrc then they would no longer be in effect in that new shell, as they did not run.

@webrunner31607
Please also read
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23172982/what-is-the-difference-between-alias-and-export-and-a-functionbash

That doesn’t seem much related to the question :<
The question isn’t about what an alias is, and doesn’t touch on variable scope or functions!

@ionatan,
But i can understand the confusion of the questioner,
as me coming from an OpenVMS environment
i always had to struggle with the peculiarities of the UNIX/UNIX-look-a-likes…

oh so a new session on the terminal automatically does “source ~/.bash_profile”? sorry im very new in programming

When you open a new terminal you’ll get a new bash session. What files it then reads depends on how your system is set up, typically you don’t have to worry about it and you just put all the commands you want to run in a new shell in .bashrc in your home directory which will then be executed on each new bash session.

what if i want to delete a alias? do i just delete them off the .bashrc file and do source .bashrc?

Unless there is a command in your .bashrc that explicitly deletes that alias then no, sourcing .bashrc would not unalias it. Sourcing just causes the commands in that file to execute. If you just want to change one thing you could do so with a command, or you could remove the command in .bashrc that sets that alias so that it doesn’t run for future shells.

656,"""hard links""","Get Help,Command Line",,8,"
This exercise teaches listing items in long format in the command terminal. In one part of the lesson, it indicates the second column in the long-format table it displays and says that it is the…
“Number of hard links. This number counts the number of child directories and files. This number includes the parent directory link (…) and current directory link (.).”
(sort of strange that it says that it counts the number of child directories and files and also somehow includes items that are not child directories and files. That also is slightly confusing to me.)
But if what is quoted up there is true then why, when I list all items in movies, does the number that counts hard links say 5 when, if you include the parent and current directory links, there are 7 total items?

Someone explain this to me?
","
This statement:

Number of hard links. This number counts the number of child directories and files. This number includes the parent directory link (..) and current directory link (.).

is simply wrong. Plain files don’t affect the number of hard links.

There is 5, because:

.
..
action
comedy
drama


Why subdirectories affect the number of hard links? Because inside them, we have the .. which points to our directory. This is a simplification, but it should clarify the hard link concept.

Oh OK, got it. So then it also doesn’t include hidden items? I guess that’s a feature of being hidden.

You’re very welcome 


So then it also doesn’t include hidden items?

It does not matter if a file is hidden. If it is a plain file (like .preferences) it will not be included, but it it is a hidden subdirectory then it will affect the number of hard links.
To test this you can simply execute these commands:
cd movies
mkdir .test
cd ..
ls -l


I guess that’s a feature of being hidden.

Well, they are not really hidden  You don’t need any extra privileges to see them, you just need to add -l to the ls command 
The purpose of the dotfiles is just not to clutter, that’s all.

ooh, I see – in the lesson they refer to them as hidden. But regardless, in this case I just wasn’t aware that .preferences was a file, but it’s obv not a directory! Thank you! 

also, good to note that it counts hidden subdirectories.

You’re welcome 

Just to clarify. Hidden file is a correct name here. I prefer to call them dotfiles, but it does not matter. What I meant is that they are are not covered by the top-secret clause  We don’t see them when we normally explore our file system, but nothing stands in our way to check them out. And system perfectly knows where they are and what they include and it will not try to pretend that dotfiles don’t exist. That is why they can be safely included in the hard links number.
They are hidden, but not in the way that it is a good idea to keep in them ideas worth millions

659,"Stucked at 8.1, I went to the directory and nothing happend","Get Help,Command Line",,8,"
So, it asks to go to the slapstick directory.
I’m in the slapstick directory and nothing occurs.
I did reset the exercice but this didnt fix anything.
I had the same issue on previous exercices and managed to bypass it by using cd in a way it seems to be expected (using it in one command or several for example, not sure)
","
Ok, I had to do it in 3 steps :
cd ..

cd ..

cd comedy/slapstick

It sucks that I can’t use cd ../../comedy/slapstick …
And a lot more other different paths I tried made me lose a lot of time…

That’s because you were in the superhero folder in the previous exercise.
On the beginning of each unit, Codecademy provides a file-tree of the directories you will be working with. I suggest you keep this link opened so you don’t have to lose a lot of time or commands figuring out how to jump from one folder to the next.
The following can be found at Command Line -> Manipulation 1:

You can reference the filesystem for this lesson here. It is highly recommended for this lesson.


LCL-fileTrees-02.png1280×768

From the above, you can see that you have to perform the following in order to change from superhero to comedy:
$ cd ../..
$ cd comedy/

Remember to use pwd to know where you are within the filesystem:

$ pwd
/home/ccuser/workspace/movies/action/superhero


I did use pwd in order to know where I was.
The problem is, that depending on the way we access to the target directory (slapstick here), the step may or may not be validated.
For example if you do it using only one command such as : cd ../../comedy/slapstick, this won’t work. When it should, the task was to change to this directory, and this does the work.
There is some other ways to go into the directory that don’t work neither.

 That is peculiar… I was able to pass through the lesson, but it was because I parsed the commands in two lines (went to home directory, then went to the comedy folder). I’ve reported the problem as a bug, but since you found other ways, I’d do the same and include those there.

Thanks, I did the same report a few steps before that, stating that there was issues with the validation of the use of cd in general.
For example, for the basic use on the first cd, if u do a basic command like ls, it validates the exercice when it shouldn’t.
I’m guessing there’s something wrong with the verification itself.
Hope this thread will help those encountering the issue.


I’m guessing there’s something wrong with the verification itself.

I’m guessing it’s a new course…obviously needs more QA. It just needs a more thorough validation.

if the file is in the same directory, you can do: source .bash_profile

bash: /home/ccuser/.bash_profile: Permission denied
And if I try it after clearing, I get this, same thing:
~/.bash_profile
bash: /home/ccuser/.bash_profile: Permission denied
So I’m probably just not typing something right or not exiting correctly…?
Well, hold on. I just redid the whole thing and after clearing typed this:
source ~/.bash_profile
And it seemed to take and I completed number 5. Might have been just me typing something in wrong.

You suppose to change the directory to 2014/dec/, but you are just writing 2014/dec/. To change a directory then you write cd (which stands for change directory) and then you write the directory name afterwards, in this case the directory name is 2014/dec/.
Remember write cd directory name.

pwd will show you the current working directory (which directory you are in), if you want to see the directorys/files in the current directory, you need ls, which will list all the files in the current directory

Thank you so much for clarifying!

 brerx:

i try to save it, enter the file name, exit and clear


I’m confused, which one of those is giving you trouble?
And when you say “not working”, what happens instead? And what would “working” mean?

Saving it is giving me problems
and it just duplicates the export PS1 thing when i press Control-O

You are being far too vague. I do not understand what the problem is.
So far I have this:
There is a problem related to saving.
Something is duplicated.
You have to make it abundantly clear what you are seeing if someone who is only reading your description is to get an understanding of the problem.
The only advice I can offer is to carefully consider what you expect to happen with each command you perform and compare everything you see to those expectations. Keep in mind that you are dealing with interactive tools, they are often displaying information or asking for information from you. When programs interact with you, you have to read what it says and use that information to continue.
If nano is confusing to you and you don’t know what is going on at all, then first consider how “normal” text editors behave and consider if nano isn’t doing the exact thing. You might also want to look for some kind of tutorial on how to use nano. It is supposed to be self-explaining but perhaps something is really tripping you up.
But the big thing to bring with you here is that you must make much more detailed observations because those observations are how you figure out what is happening and what you need to do.

For somebody else to be able to understand what you describe you will generally need to explain in sufficient detail that they can reproduce the problem.
If it can’t be reproduced by the other person, then even more detail is required, since they are no longer able to make their own observations.

The line tells me to type (export PS1="">> "") minus the parantheses
I type said command, and then it tells me to save it, press enter to write the filename, exit nano, and clear the terminal window
When I attempt to save it using the Control-O method it just duplicates the command, thus not allowing me to write the filename, exit nano, etc.
Essentially i wanna know if im just reading the command wrong or Im adding something unnecessary

i got it, i logged off so i had to retype the nano ~/.bash_profile
thanks for trying to help with my vague questions lmao, ill work on that in the future
Best,
Brerx

http://storage3.static.itmages.com/i/16/0621/h_1466548698_7133702_825324ef70.png
That is asking for a file name and is already suggesting the name of the file I opened when starting nano. That’s the closest thing I can imagine that remotely fits your description of “command is duplicated”.
I don’t know what you’re seeing and how that is different from what you expect. I still have nothing to go by.

You’ll have to get your whereabouts.
Maybe you moved somewhere else first, so that giving cd a relative path no longer refers to an existing location.

And I should be able to do that with pwd, correct?
Sorry, super new over here.
I appreciate the help!




 pyace74652:

That’ll tell you where you are, but nothing about where everything else is.
You’ll need to decide what action you want to take, find out how to do that, and then do it.
For example you can:
print all files in the current directory
print all files of another directory
print all files recursively
search for a file matching a name

just use cd …

Same for me with the pipe ‘|’ symbol, stuck in the middle of the course and can’t go further…tried keyboard, copy/paste, virtual Keybord from OS (win7) and virtual Keyboard from VirusProgramm, in different Browsers…

Hi guys,
I’ve seen other people with the same issue (I haven’t run into it) suggesting that you make sure you’re using a QWERTY keyboard layout.
I use Dvorak on Ubuntu based Linux, and haven’t had any issues with not being able to type certain characters in the Codecademy terminal, though.

Well, I use Skandinavian keyboard which is basically the same except a few special characters (å, ä, ö). But otherwise there is no differences in the layout.

Have you tried switching to QWERTY though/did QWERTY work for you?

Here you can see the layout: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/fi/a/ad/Skandinaavinen_näppäimistö.png
As I said it’s basically the same as the normal keyboard, but I have to press ctrl+alt+4 instead of shift+4 to get “$”. Maybe it has something to do with that.

Just activate american layout so u can use it to type $. I had the exact same problem.




 agathebauer:

the course and can’t go furthe


Same for me, impossible to write pipe symbol. I´ve tried all options. The monitor no recognized the pipe from the virtual keyboard. I can not continue with “cat volcanoes.txt | wc” in 55%. Sorry.

Found a workaround that works for me (win7). Annoying but works.
I’m using german keyboard schema. Pipe Symbol is at ‘ctrl+alt+7’ or ‘altGr+7’ (= three keys)
As mentioned, you have to switch the keyboard-schema, at least to type these single ‘not working’ characters, to a schema who has these chars as a ‘two-key-combination’.
I searched at https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/goglobal/bb964651.aspx a keyboard schema who has the pipe symbol just with two keys. And I found ‘Latvian QWERTY’, who has the pipe at its ‘shift+’ (= two keys). Added this schema to my German(swiss) and German(french), and placed the language switcher at the toolbar.
If I need the pipe, switch to Latvian, hitting shift+< on my keyboard, and than switch back to german.
As I said, annoying, but works, until this is fixed. I guess the editor (its JavaScript) has problems to ‘catch’ three-keys combinations.
Cheers
Roger

One way would be to use the ascii code e.g. for $ it would be hold ALT+36 or for the pipe ALT+124

Thanks for your hint.
But that doesn’t work, at least for me.
Seems like the editors JavaScript can’t ‘read’ this too.

Same problem here with “|” character on “cat volcanoes.txt | wc”

working with ALT+124, thanks haxor789

None of these workarounds work for me. I have tried holding down ALT and pressig 36. The prompt $ changes to (arg: 36). But I get no dollar sign.

Take that dollar sign from your post and copy and paste it?

How can I paste it? Ctrl-V doesn’t work. When I right click I get no paste option.

In consoles you often need to use CTRL+SHIFT+V

That didn’t work either unfortunately. CTRL+SHIFT+V inputs ^V instead of $.

Ok tested it myself and it fails for me as well 
What worked is to use ALT + 36 where you take 36 from the num block not from the numbers above your letter keys.

I’ll try that nd report back when I come home later today. I don’t have a num lock button on my laptop. When I tried alt+36 on the number pad of the Mac keyboard it flipped my screens

While doing this exercise, you are using the nano text editor. To make it work, you need to use nano commands.  The command to save a file, WriteOut (^O) is done with the control and O keys – not the command key.

After opening the nano terminal, I type in Ctrl O, Ctrl + O, but nothing happens after pressing enter. Somebody please help?

Type or use the key combination? Got a screenshot so that we can make our own observations?
Pressing enter in nano should create a new line, or if you’re entering a file-name for saving or opening, then pressing enter would tell nano that you’re done typing.
Nano gives you feedback with messages near the bottom of the screen, right above the list of commands, perhaps it’s saying something that you are not noticing.
There are also other editors/ways of editing text, if things really aren’t working for you with nano. But it’s probably a good idea to figure out what’s going wrong.

Your supposed to use the control button on your keyboard along with o.

thanks a lot for your reply.
I have gotten past my problem, finally. Well, don’t I feel stupid.
I just needed to press the “Ctrl” + “O” & “Ctrl” + “X” keys combinations without having to type them into the nano terminal.

Okay, so what happens when you do?

Thanks for your reply. I used the keys combinations and walah! it worked!
I’ve felt so stupid though, It was there all along.

Oh, ok. Well, I don’t have any ideas of why it isn’t working then.

On the third step then you wrote cat > islands.txt, the exercise is simply asking you to output the contents of islands.txt using cat. To fix this then just take out the > sign.
What I usually like to do is mess around with exercises after I’ve completed them so that I get a better feel for the code, which is what you can do too  Hope this helped.

By using
cat volcanos.txt | wc
you got an [output] to your screen

$ cat islands.txt | wc

In response to this windows 10 did actually integrate(beta) the linux terminal into it and you are able to run linux commands on it, to what extent I’m unsure.
It is in beta so not sure how reliable it will be.

Depends on what you want to do.
If you want GNU utilities (grep and the like) then have a look at cygwin
But you’re still on windows, so anything that is at all reliant on how the OS works will behave differently. For example, your file system doesn’t start at / in windows.

I recieve a code academy error, denoted by the red box at the bottom of the screen.

All/ any help would be appreciated.

My Answer:
$ cd /home/ccuser/workspace/blog/2014/dec
Error:
“Use the change directory command to switch into the 2014/dec/ directory.”
Question Context:
The mkdir command stands for “make directory”. It takes
in a directory name as an argument, and then creates a new directory in
the current working directory.
Here we used mkdir to create a new directory named media/ inside the feb/ directory.
Steps:

Navigate to the 2014/dec/ directory.
List all files and directories in the working directory.
2.Then type
“touch keyboard.txt”
Again, list all files and directories in the working directory. You’ll see that there is now a new file named keyboard.txt.

","
Hm… I am using a firefox browser and those exercises never errored.
Maybe, you have to update the firefox browser? Anyway hopefully, it works again. And/Or codeacademy helps!
Happy coding!

It’s probably looking for cd 2014/dec (relative from current directory, not absolute path)
A lot of tests are on what you type, not on what effect it had 

Hi ionatan,
Even when I started again from excercise 1 the same error occured at the same point.
So further to your suggestion, unfortunately even though I was at the most approrpiate path based on previous excercises I still recieved an error.
I will attempt it again though making sure I make no mistakes and enter in the ideal text and let you know how I go.
Is there any chance you have done the excersie and are able to provide me with all the lines of code you used?
Cheers,
nicbono

brb I’ll check what it’s looking for

It’s looking for either of:
cd 2014/dec/
cd 2014/dec
And it has to be successful, so you should enter either of them from  ~/workspace/blog (assuming that’s where 2014 is located, that’s what you you said with  /home/ccuser/workspace/blog/2014/dec
Could also cheat it with:
mkdir -p 2014/dec
cd 2014/dec

since the command will be successful if the directory exists
…but if you have to do that then there might be something wrong with what files are there

Hi Ionatan,
I restarted the training and managed to overcome the error similar to what you suggested



 ionatan:

A lot of tests are on what you type, not on what effect it had


Thank you for your efforts! I think this is resolved 
althought I will note some sadness towards the truth behind your statement. I wish the tutorial was not based of writing exactly what you write as apposed to what effect I have made.

flags (-R) are case-sensitive.

I wrote with a a big R on top of the bash… doesnt work with upper case either?

hm… Weird, everything seems fine. Try refreshing the page.

Just did, still doesnt work ;(…

spelling Arctic correctly does help, you misspelled it. yours only has one c, while ArCtic has two (i made it uppercase, so you can see it better, make it lowercase to pass the exercise)

Thanks, works now… Figured it’d be something like that.

Hello, it just says “Type the command after the shell prompt.”…

Hello @melkerx,  I’m going to have to give you the same reply as I gave @zaradesign:

You are typing it in the right place, but you have a typing mistake, it should be Arctic not Artic.

So I have been working through the assignment and all of a sudden it refuses to allow me to progress. Even though I am 100% certain that I have done the right steps… any ideas?

Have you tried hitting enter after writing cp biopic/ray.txt and then on the next line writing biopic/notorious.txt historical?

I just managed to get it to work by resetting and following the exact same instructions and methods as I have been… but this wasn’t the first time I reset either. By that I mean it took several attempts to work. I am confused as to whether this was just an issue in the lesson or I did something terrible

Image here for evidence.

It was probably a bug in the lesson, you should report it. Also, I was taking a guess at why it wasn’t working when I gave you my answer  I hoped that it would work, but your way works just as well. Good luck in future lessons.

Cheers for the help man! I will file a bug report on it.

Probably the extra spaces. There are usually many ways to do a task and a lot of codecademy exercises don’t check if the task was done but instead just look for some specific piece of text. That leads to passing stuff that was used in the wrong context and not passing things that are equivalent.

And the way to solve that is by googling. Not so that you won’t bother others, but because that’s the easiest way to find out and it’s something that you need to learn to use liberally.
“bash navigate up one directory”
go.

Thanks but I’m already done that lesson

You’re really not helping anyone by saying that on every post…

You’ll have to be more specific if you think that there is something I could do better.
If you mean that I should just tell people to copy some command, then that really doesn’t help anyone beyond getting past the current exercise, does it?

Hello! I have just completed the learn the command line and git courses. I am trying to upload a webpage of my own to githubs servers but I need to create a new respository. In the launch a website course we accessed the terminal through Codecademy. However, I am very confused as to how to access the terminal through windows. I have tried both using the cmd and the Powershell. Neither of which have worked. Anyone have any input here? Thanks!

The same is happening myself I have put a space between the search name and the path to the directory and it still dosen’t work

Each one of those is slightly different from what’s in the instructions
Yes, that is one command, that all goes on one line. It breaks on a space, there is a space there.
The file system’s root is /, if you omit the /, then you are giving a relative path from where you are now
The text to search for is Arctic, not Artic

Arctic – that is the word you are searching for
/home/ccuser/workspace/geography – that is the path to the directory that you are searching in
Don’t mash them together, put a space between them.

Thank you so much!!!

Hey, so I’m Caz, and I am trying to type something in after the shell prompt, keeping in mind I am trying to do exactly what Codecademy is telling me, and it keeps saying that I am not typing the correct thing in after the shell prompt. I typed verbatim

What is the shell prompt


Artic


Check your spelling there.

In learn the command line lesson 5 step 3 it say then type “cd…” i typed that and it said that it was wrong can someone help please help thanks
","
You want to type:
cd ..

Notice the space between the two.
cd means Change Directory, and using it with … makes it go “up” once in the file tree.
So, if you were in C:\users\person it would take you to C:\users.

Ignore the suggestion that you might be able to use cp (copy) to change directories.  Just look back a few exercises to where we learned about using cd.

Same here. I think the instruction for navigating two levels up is incorrect. But again, as you said, even you managed to navigate to the action/ directory you still cannot go thru and activate the next step. I have been stuck here too. I think the design can be improved in such a way so that even there is a problem with one specific step you should still be able to move forward.

Are you referring to this instruction?
cd ../../action/

If you are trying to use that command and are in the satire directory and you are getting an error then there is a problem.
This is what you should see:
$ pwd

$ pwd                                                                                            
/home/ccuser/workspace/movies/action   


Yes, that is where the problem is. From satire/ and by cd …/…/action I ended up in movies/comedy/, not movies/action/.
If I don’t follow instructions exactly I can navigate to movies/action/, but no matter what I cannot turn that checkbox green and move forward 

If you ended up at movies/comedy, you likely added space after the first /, like this:
cd ../ ../action

how to use the pwd and ld command inside CMD / command prompt on windows

Windows uses a different shell and is an entirely different environment.
It’s also slightly questionable why you would want to.
But as for how, google for it, that’s how everyone finds stuff like that… “windows cmd change directory” “windows cmd list files” etc
I’m on a linux machine right now, and looking at my task bar, I’ve got just a browser and everything else is terminals. It makes sense to control my system from the command line, that’s how it’s designed. Windows? not so much, they are more in the point-and-click business, whatever sells to the lowest common denominator.
When it comes to servers, they are playing catch-up to unix-systems and they try to lock you down to their platform, whereas unix-like systems are mostly based on free software that exists to do as you wish, not to work for some company. This makes linux a friendlier premise for deploying your software, because the stuff you rely has guarantees about its continued existence and isn’t controlled by some corporation.

You need to have a clear idea of what it is you want to be doing.
The instructions are to add something in a file.
What you’re doing instead is to use the command directly in the shell, I’m sure that if you stop and think for a bit, you’ll agree that isn’t what the instructions are asking for.
So, what does it mean to open a file? If it tells you that the file is missing, what can you do to to make it exist? What exactly should the file contain?
These are all things that you can figure out from your experience with graphical interfaces, so start by getting your intentions figured out so that you don’t have to try a bunch of stuff that you can already determine isn’t what you’re meant to do, and likewise, you can determine what it is you need to do.
If you just know what it is you want to happen, then you can look up how to do that. From the instructions, or previous exercises, or by googling.

Hm maybe it’s possible that you’re getting error because you are trying to navigate to the folder you are already in. Try using ls, then enter some other folder (if there is any) and try to go back with cd ... I can’t see what you’re doing wrong, you’re typing the right commands.

I’m probably typing something incorrectly? I’m sure I’ll eventually figure out what I’m doing wrong lol.

This the problem I keep running into. Can you tell me where I’m going wrong?

Yes, you’re using wrong command. Check this picture.

I was located inside /drama/historical folder. By using cd .., I navigated one folder out, into the /drama folder.

You definitely do not use the cp (copy) command to change directory.

You are probably not giving it a command that it understands. What is the terminal telling you when you try?

I’m also stuck here. I’m typing cd - to move back one directory to drama, where it says to go, but it’s not completing the task. I’m not sure what it’s looking for.

Instead of
cd -

you should be using
cd ..

be careful of spacing
“cd …” works
“cd . .” does not work

You use the cd command and include the directory that you want to end up at.
Doing that is very straightforward if you can see the directory that you want to end up inside your working directory.
Ask the terminal to show you what is inside your working directory like this:
ls

Do you see the 2015 directory in there?  I hope you do because then you can use the cd command combined with that directory name, like this:
cd 2015/

Hi Abhijit,
A few of the commands might work on Windows, but the course is for Unix and Unix based operating systems’ command lines. So no Windows, sorry.

There is a very simple reason for this: windows command prompt is a different shell than the ones possibly used on Unix and Linux systems where commonly nowadays the Bash is the default shell.

Have you had a look at the instruction highlighted in red?
Oh. That’s what you wrote.
Have you copied it exactly? Did it move you to that directory?
What if you do it without the trailing slash?
Maybe you had trailing spaces in your command?

i typed exactly how the instrucions show : cd …/ …/action/   and still got error

I think you made some super minor “typo”, might have satisfied bash but the checkpoint only looks at what you entered.
Try copying from the instruction and make sure there are no extra characters.
Trailing slash should work, but you can try without it as well

Your screenshot makes it look like you entered:
cd ../ ../action/

Which has an additional space in it and only moves you one directory up (since the first argument is ..

you right the space was the problem , thx a lot .

Same situation here, once I opened up the nano editor, and beneath the greeting line, I typed pd=“pwd”. then I pressed ctrl + O and then ctrl + X. It just wouldn’t pass !  HELPS APPRECIATED!!!
","
having this same problem! Would love some help if you’ve figured this out!

I found that when I first opened the file it had an extra line “~/.bash_profile” above my greeting, after I deleted the that line and proceeded with the rest of the instructions, I had only two lines left: echo “Welcome, (name)” with alias pd=“pwd” underneath. After that it worked for me.
Hope this helps
Cheers~

~/ .bash_profile


You’ve added a space in the path there:
~/ .bash_profile

That is causing your file to be created in the wrong place.
Remember that when you are at the $ prompt, you can use pwd to see which directory you are in and also ls -la to see the files and sub-directories in that folder.
The plan in this exercise is to make a file called .bash_profile in your home (~) directory, instead you have created a file called welcome.txt in your … well, I’m not sure, maybe your music directory? – use pwd and ls to find out.

Give us a couple screenshots of your whole web browser so that we can see what you see.

@lisuda,
The Course started with…
Each time we launch the terminal application, it creates a =new= session.
The session immediately loads settings and preferences
that make up the command line environment.
We can configure the environment to support the commands and programs we create.
This enables us to
customize greetings
and
customize command aliases,
and
create variables
to share across commands and programs.
You can reference the filesystem for this lesson here.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_Hierarchy_Standard
##===============================================
You created a file in nano called ~/.bash_profile in your /home directory
( the =home directory= can be identified by using ~ )
and added a greeting. How does this work?
$ nano ~/.bash_profile
~/.bash_profile is the name of file used to store environment settings.
It is commonly called the “bash profile”.
When a session starts,
it will load the contents of the bash profile before executing commands.
The ~ represents the user’s home directory.
The . indicates a hidden file.
The name ~/.bash_profile is important,
since this is how the command line recognizes the bash profile.

1.The command nano ~/.bash_profile opens up ~/.bash_profile in nano.
2.The text echo ""Welcome, Jane Doe"" creates a greeting in the bash profile, which is saved. It tells the command line to echo the string “Welcome, Jane Doe” when a terminal session begins.
3.The command source ~/.bash_profile
activates the changes in ~/.bash_profile for the current session.
Instead of closing the terminal and needing to start a new session,
source makes the changes available right away in the session we are in.

##===============================================


1.Now that we know what bash profile is, let’s continue configuring the environment by adding command aliases.
Open ~/.bash_profile in nano.


2… In ~/.bash_profile, beneath the greeting you created, type
alias pd=""pwd""


What happens when you store this alias in ~/.bash_profile?
alias pd=“pwd”
The alias command allows you to create keyboard shortcuts, or aliases, for commonly used commands.
1.Here alias pd=""pwd"" creates the alias pd for the pwd command,
which is then saved in the bash profile.
Each time you enter pd, the output will be the same as the pwd command.
2.The command source ~/.bash_profile
makes the alias pd available in the current session.
Each time we open up the terminal, we can use the pd alias.


1… Let’s practice aliases some more. Open ~/.bash_profile in nano.


2… In the bash profile, beneath the previous alias, add
alias hy=""history""


Save the file.  Press Enter to write the filename.

3… Add another alias
alias ll=""ls -la""


Save the file. Press Enter to write the filename.  Exit nano
Clear the terminal window.
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5367068/clear-the-ubuntu-bash-screen-for-real


4…In the command line, use source to activate the changes to the bash profile for the current session.


5…Let’s try out the aliases. In the command line, type
hy


6…Now type
ll


###---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What happens when you store the following aliases in ~/.bash_profile?
alias hy=""history""
hy is set as alias for the history command in the bash profile.
The alias is then made available in the current session through source.
_source ~/.bash_profile
By typing hy,
the command line outputs a history of commands that were entered in the current session.
alias ll=""ls -la""
ll is set as an alias for the command ls -la
and made available in the current session through source ~/.bash_profile.
By typing ll, the command line now outputs
all contents and directories in long format, including all hidden files.
##=========================================








Now that you are familiar with configuring greetings and aliases, let’s move on to setting environment variables.
Open ~/.bash_profile in nano.








In the bash profile, beneath the aliases, on a new line, type
export USER=""Jane Doe""
Feel free to use your own name.
Save the file.
Press Enter to write the filename.
Exit nano.
Finally, clear the terminal.


3.In the command line, use the  source ~/.bash_profile command,
to activate the changes in the bash profile for the current session.
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4608187/how-to-reload-bash-profile-from-the-command-line
source ~/.bash_profile


4… Type
echo $USER
This should return the value of the variable that you set.

@eni.neni,
What do you not understand…

i typed “Hello, I am nano.”
and then i have no idea what to do after that and how to clear. i think im suppose to type Ctrl + O
then Ctrl + X and then after that i dont know

after you saved it (ctrl + O) (enter to confirm) and exited (ctrl + X) you need to clear the terminal, guess what the command is? It is: clear, to clear the terminal, you need to type clear, kind of make sense

im sorry i still dont understand what to do

what exactly do i type from the beginning

do i type it in the box they provide because they said to type it at the top of windows i have no idea what that means




 eni.neni:

do i type it in the box they provide because they said to type it at the top of windows i have no idea what that means


Are you talking about typing some content in hello.txt (the text file) or are you talking about how you can save and exit nano (the text editor)?

i just don’t understand what the thing is asking me to do. i dont know what to write, where to write it, and how to write it

for number 2. In nano, at the top of the window, type
“Hello, I am nano.”
Using the menu at the bottom of the terminal for reference, type Ctrl + O (the letter, not the number) to save the file. This is the letter “O”, not the number zero.
Press Enter, when prompted about the filename to write.
Then type Ctrl + X to exit nano.
Finally, type clear to clear the terminal window. The command prompt should now be at the top of the window.

First you need to understand that the exercise is showing you how to use nano which is a text editor.
First it is asking you to start the nano program and at the same time open a file called hello.txt
nano hello.txt

Then it is asking you to type one line into the hello.txt file:
""Hello, I am nano.""

You next task is to save your work by pressing this key combination:
ctrl o

Then you have  a chance to confirm the filename.
Your next task is to close nano using
ctrl x

Then your final task it so clear the terminal window using this command:
clear

At what point in that series of steps have we lost you?

i do all that but nothing happens. There’s no x There’s no check. nothing happens

this is whats there

I gave the file a name - but it did not solve the problem, I appreciate the answer, though. Any other suggestions, I would really like to finish this exercise.

I semmed to have a simmilar problem with this exercise, the thing is, that you have to write the instructions shown in the instruction pannel. There it says you have to write nano ‘~/.bash_profile’ - notice that this is a whole word. After this, Write the text into the nano text editor, “Hello, Nano” or whatever you want, press Ctrl + O, and you shouldn’t have to add a name to the profile cause you already created one: ‘bash_profile’. Now press enter and exit the nano, clear, and finally you should be able to continue with the excersice. Hope this result usefull to you.

787,Lesson 4.8 explanation - PATH variable and /bin scripts,"Get Help,Command Line",,4,"
Good day everyone,
First I wanted to thank the people who run Codecademy, that place like this exists !
In the lesson Environment variables 4.8 while following the instructions  for the variable $PATH, there is a part which says;
1.Type
echo $PATH
2.Type
/bin/pwd
3.Type
/bin/ls
…
After Typing by instructions 1. echo $PATH  and Enter, instructions says :  Looking carefully, echo $PATH lists the following directories: …    _Each directory contains scripts for the command line to execute. The PATH variable simply lists which directories contain scripts.
After Typing by instructions 2 /bin/pwd    …  is terminal supposed to output a file or script that contains this command ?  And what are the scripts, are they actual files that can be found in the directories that **echo $PATH"" lists.
Anyone can explain this ?
Thanks !
Uros

you don’t understand how $PATH works? It is a bit difficult. Lets look at this string:
/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin

(i know, slightly different then the lesson, but i couldn’t copy it from the lesson). What is happening? This is a string which contains all the locations where executable files are. They are separated by the colon, so we have 3 paths:
/usr/local/sbin
/usr/local/bin
/usr/bin

why are paths important? If you type ls or cd in the terminal, it going to check all directory’s in your PATH variable to find the command (program) to execute. You can verify this, if you run:
whereis ls

it will show:
ls: /usr/bin/ls

he, /usr/bin is in our PATH. It would be impractical to type /usr/bin/ls each time. The path does this for us  It also gives you the option to create directory in your home directory (outside codecademy), which you can add to your path, and store personal scripts 
I hope this explains what path does, and why it is rather useful

Thanks stetim94 I pretty much get the feeling of how PATH works.
And when you mention storing personal scripts, what are you referring to ?
Are scripts files that are stored in the PATH ?  can you open and edit the script somehow ?

It worked with cd …/…/action (without last slash). I still cannot understand why. I tried different variants, but only this one worked, but not from the first try.

I am stuck on the same thing. I tried doing what both of you said, but it’s not working for me.

Never mind, I tried cd…/…/action with no spaces or the last / and it worked. Don’t really know why…

Yes, cd …/…/action/ works and so does cd …  next line cd … next line cd action/ but it does not let you move on to the next segment. What I did is actually proceed following the greyed out parts and the result worked but still could not move on. The problem is that the certain set of commands aren’t recognized to trigger the check-mark only all of them together on one line do.

I know the -r option means ‘recursive’ but I don’t remember seeing this, can’t seem to find in the glossary also.
Thanks for any help.

","
well, like you say, -r means recursive. You can check the man pages? In the command line, run: man rm. Man is short for manual. In short, recursive allows you to remove a directory, with all its sub directory’s.
-f stands for force, some files are protected, force will force you will and remove the protected files

Ok, thanks a lot, I’ll look into it further later on.

can anyone tell me what did i miss please?

cd only takes one argument: the folder you want to go to.
A folder can be four different things:

The name of a directory  in the current directory (do ls to find these)

.: this means ‘the current directory’, so this has no effect

.. this means ‘one directory back’
A combination of the three above, for instance cd ./../code/python/../ruby will result in going one folder up, in the ‘code’ folder and then in the ‘ruby’ folder

Not much would happen. Why? First off, the directory that contains all the directory’s (the root directory (/)), you wouldn’t have the privileges as normal user to write (or remove) files.
Secondly, unless you include recursive (-r), only files will be removed, no directory’s.
Still not recommend to run the command. You can actually do it, install a virtualbox, then run (in the virtualbox): (WARNING!! BE VERY CAREFUL HERE) sudo rm -rf /*

Try with:

Instead of:

Makes no difference to cd but codecademy might not accept all correct versions… I don’t know if that’s it, I’m not able to test this without considerable effort since the exercises aren’t repeatable

Well, just mashing in the commands doesn’t take any time when you know what to do, so I did. And what you typed:
cd drama/biopic/

Passes the first checkpoint in that exercise just fine.
If you mean that the first checkpoint turns green but not the second - then the second checkpoint isn’t to list anything, it is to copy a file.

The exercises aren’t supported on iOS or Android. I have had some success on Android by telling my browser to ask for the desktop version of the page. Results for that may vary by browser. I have not personally tested on iOS.

I’ve tried on iOS, it may work, but it’s not really worth the effort because it’s pretty broken.

cd directory: change directory
let you move to a specific directory. cd . is the current dir, cd .. is the one containing the current dir (parent directory), and cd name moves to a directory in the current directory (sub directory).
Maybe just go up and down with cd and let ls tell you what is inside of the directories. For more information one probably needs more information about your problem.

Hi, I got passed it, but I dont really understand the logic in the command. I start of piping the content in volcanoes.txt into a command called wc (supose it stands for words-characters?). After that I pipe it to cat. Wasnt  cat the command used to print out the content inside a certain file ? I dont understand how i can pipe standard output into cat as a standard input being cat a command, not a file or directory. Can someone please help ?

Your command is slightly different!

Thanks for replying. I have checked my code and it seems to be exactly what is contained in the instructions. In what way is my code slightly different?

Step up your comparison game!

Look harder (I spotted this in seconds, the fonts in your screenshot are designed to be unambiguous)
Copy one of them below the other
Use Python or some other language to compare the strings, remove half until there’s only one differing character left.
Convert the text to bytes, compare each byte value
Use an online tools for comparing text
Or even circumvent the problem of finding the difference and copy-paste from the instructions


Ok thanks for the advice 

Hi,did you get it to work? I have the same problem and I don’t really understand the other reply because my code is exactly the same as in the instruction and its still not working

 wolfsbanes8bitworld:

What happened instead? Avoid using the word “work” to describe something because all that says is that it didn’t meet your expectations which isn’t describing what happened at all.
If you successfully copied the file then you should be able to run this command:
diff -s frida.txt lincoln.txt
And it should tell you that the files are identical. If it says anything else then you got it wrong, and that output would even explain in what way you got it wrong - if they are different it would say exactly how they differ and if either file is missing, it would say that.

Some commands can take input both as files and as standard input, what you’re doing is to redirect a file to cat’s standard input, you’re expected to let cat read directly from the file instead.
Python is another example of this:
$ echo ""print('hello world')"" > hello.py # create a really short python script
$ python hello.py # tell python about the file it should read
hello world
$ python < hello.py # redirect python's standard input to the file

When you write like this you try to execute .bash_profile as a program. .bash_profile doesn’t have the execution permission, so that is what the error message means.
You want to open the file with a text editor instead. From what I remember it’s “nano” that you use in this course.

It is nano and I really got it that the error message means the program doesn’t have the execution permission.  And the problem is that, it isn’t possible to get INTO the text editor because that has a nasty habit of dropping below the frame of the workspace.
As answers go, that wasn’t terribly helpful.

Well, running .bash_profile as an executable is the reason you get that error message. If you have issues with starting nano maybe your question and screenshot should have been about that instead?

I’m quite aware that running bash_profile as an executable is the reason I got the error message.
As evidenced by the fact that I COULD GET an error message, the problem is not with starting nano, but with getting into the editorial space to perform any actions AFTER starting.
The reason the screen shot looks as it does is that was the ONLY thing visible.  I would be happy to provide a screenshot of that so you can see what I mean.




 emmatank:

I would be happy to provide a screenshot of that so you can see what I mean.


Yes please. I would like to see what you mean.

So, you enter
$ nano ~/.bash_profile

and nothing happens / it exits? If that’s the case something is really wrong with the exercise/system. But I’m not sure how your original question was related to that…

this, as you can see, is full-screen.  And it is not possible to access any of the commands at the bottom of the page.  Not only that, but the side menu has a really nasty habit of losing the slider so it is impossible to move up or down to see previous text.  In order to obtain the slider, it is necessary to resize the screen.  It has happened more than once that doing that results in the disappearance of whatever had been entered on the screen.

 emmatank:

I can reproduce the problem with Firefox on OS X. The good news is that even though you can’t see the list of commands at the bottom, you can still perform the keystrokes necessary to save the file and exit from nano.

I just filled out the Report a Bug form in that exercise to let them know about this problem. If you have time, you should do that too.

Right.  In theory.  However, as I said, the 2nd part of the problem is that the slider (on the right side of the instruction panel) DISAPPEARS ENTIRELY, and can only be obtained by RESIZING THE BROWSER, which then causes ALL DATA to vanish.  COMPLETELY.  which means that whatever was there is gone, and not re-obtainable.  And, as a extra bit of fun, the slider then vanishes again once the browser has been resized, which means that getting access to whatever was sought from the instruction panel is now, basically pointless since all data from the exercise has disappeared.

and things are now getting SO much more amusing.  went back to restart #2.  Again.  for the I’m not sure how many-th time.
entered nano ~/.bash_profile.
got to step 2 (had to resize the browser screen to get access to the slider on the instruction panel).  entered “Welcome, etc”, then command o.  entered a file name.  pressed enter.  then command x.  then “clear” (and had to resize the browser screen at each step to be able to see the edit line.
then:  nothing.  Nada,  nichivo.  rien.  clum.  bupkus.
Step 3 not active.  at all.
However, I went ahead and entered ""source ~/.bash_profile and got…“file not found.”

Looks like you’re running a Mac ?

and now things are getting fun in a not-at-all kind of way.  Changing browsers to Safari resulted in Codeacademy crashing completely AND making my system freeze to the point that I had to shut down (so no screenshot–I took one, but Preview wouldn’t open to let me double-check to see how much I had captured).
And because I couldn’t do ANYTHING at all, it was impossible to leave a bug report.
I restarted the computer, still in Safari, and through steps 1 and 2 (I think, because even in Safari, while edit commands at the bottom of the screen are visible, the slider for the instruction panel disappears.  Unlike Firefox. however, resizing the browser screen in Safari does NOT restore the slider, so it was impossible to see if step 3 had been highlighted.
I could only infer it from the red  outlined box at the bottom of the screen which demanded that I enter the source command for the file.  However, since that part of the instruction panel was unavailable because the slider had ceased to exist, I was unable to obtain the command structure to execute that command.
this is really fun in a not-by-any-stretch-of-the-imagination kind of way.
and here is a screenshot of the workspace, with the instruction panel at step 2, step 3 is not available because the slider does not exist, and a demand at the bottom of the screen that I execute a command whose structure is unavailable because there is no way to access the necessary information:88c583865089207068e82f88fe03c9bb075b3b38.png1212×896

 




Having gotten out of 2 and back into 3 (not sure how or why), I am once again where all of this started:  entered ~/.bash_profile and got “permission denied.”  Again.
However, as you can see, despite “permission denied,” and despite the fact that the greeting I entered did NOT come up on the screen, I WAS continued on to step 2–which was pretty pointless since, on entering ""alias pd=“pwd” absoultely NOTHING happened:
d1b8f91fbe9167eb067e058a3349dbc58aa42842.png1237×900

As we can see, “~/.bash_profile” accomplished nothing but “pemission denied.”
entering ""alias pd=“pwd” also did nothing at all.
going back to “source ~/.bash_profile” recalled the greeting I had entered.
“alias pd=pwd”, however, resulted in NOTHING.
not only that, but command O did NOT save anything, and command x did NOT exit the program.
and, to make things even more fun (as if they couldn’t be already), the slider on the information panel is, as always, unavailable unless the browser is resized.a10db8488865ba0bff12f16d1d248758ff707b7a.png1232×877

the answer to the problem of “permission denied” was simple:  type “nano ~/.bash_profile”
the problem was that because the slider on the information panel disappeared (unless the browser was resized), it was impossible to know what command was missing.
and because resizing the browser meant losing any data that had been inputted, it was impossible to resume entering code once the information had been located.

I also get the same problems like you all do. I’m currently filling out a bug report for this. I even tried to complete the last two steps but it didn’t do what it was supposed to do. I was enjoying this course until these bugs had to ruin it 

Maybe you’re using a small monitor? I’m using a 15.6"" laptop and I can see ALL of the commands on the bottom. Maybe it’s not a big bug, probably just a small bug for small screens.

840,Number of hard links,"Get Help,Command Line",,5,"
here hardlinks in the directory drama is given 6, but I think it will be 4, drama itself, parent directory movies and child directories biopoc and historical. If we consider the child files of the child directories too then the hard links of comedy should be 6 too instead of 4. What’s wrong in here?
I’m doing lesson 2 (3/10) in command sections.
","
If you’re refering to the example then we don’t know what’s in that directory. Try it on a directory that you can inspect (and keep in mind that there could be hidden files, so use ls -la)

No, it is okay now. That was another example. When I typed into terminal actual results came. But it did not include child files just child directories. But in the example it is said that child files and directories number are also added.
And another further more question, in my own computer where can I get that terminal? I tried the command prompt but no help. And the “$” sign given on the top of the terminal- is it a must? Should we type it when we try it on our pc?
Thanks for helping me anyways 

This course is for Linux/Mac, not Windows. 

Yes, it counts the number of links to itself. Each child directory, itself, and its parent has a hard link to it.
$ is just a prompt, telling you that the shell is ready to receive a command, it can look any way you want, some commonly included information in the prompt is current directory, username, hostname, date/time…
If you’re on linux or mac which are both unix-like, then the terminal should be easily accessible, you’ve probably got some search feature for finding programs which should be able to find it.
Windows is different… You can get bash for windows but I don’t particularly recommend it. The shell is a way to control your computer and windows already has that all figured out with point-and-click stuff, while for linux the terminal is the main interface… mac sort of does both I suppose. So what the shell is good at is automating tasks and typing what you want as opposed to finding a button that does what you want. There might not be such a button. So since its purpose is to control the OS, it makes sense to use an OS that’s built with the terminal in mind. My suggestion is therefore to install virtualbox or some other hypervisor and then install some linux distro in a virtual machine. Doesn’t really matter which distro they all use the same stuff for the most part, with the main differences being in how they are maintained (release cycles, how recent the software is) so roll dice between Fedora (more recent software) or Mint (more point and click, whatever that’s supposed to help with)
Also note that the terminal in the command line course is hooked up to what is as really close to a full OS (ubuntu to be specific) so everything there are real tools and you can go right ahead and download, compile and install stuff that’s missing in there, that obviously takes a bit of know-how, but all of this does.[quote=“cadecodes, post:4, topic:29311, full:true”]
This course is for Linux/Mac, not Windows.
[/quote]
Strictly speaking we can very much have GNU environments in Windows too. All it takes is a C compiler and then just install the rest from there. If you sat me down at a Windows computer and told me I had to use it, then I’d do that and just ignore the fact that it’s a Windows machine. Makes more sense to simply use a unix-like system though.

Who says we can’t? If i am correct you could use:

cd … will go to parent directory, and then from there, go to sisterdirectory.
We can also do:

What if you copy the command from the instructions? My understanding is that you should be passed regardles of whether the command succeeded, as long as the correct text is entered. And since you’re not passed, and since bash is confused, then perhaps there is some ever so subtle difference from what’s in the instructions.
I don’t see any indication of that it’s not exactly the same. Just the above reasoning.

Well, unfortunatelly I cannot copy anything to the command line within that course.  Can just anyone give me the greenlight to pass this task, cause otherwise I am stuck 

The terminal window eats up Ctrl+V yeah but you might be able to right-click->paste
You can also type out that command here in the forum for us to inspect, should be able to tell if it’s the correct characters or not by comparing to the correct string in unicode or inspecting it somehow.
You can do that same test yourself as well if you have Python interpreter or something, do this in a terminal:
$ python -c 'print(""cp * satire/"" == ""cp * satire/"")'

If the problem is a fancy (unicode) * symbol, then this will help. The ASCII code for * is  42, hold Alt and type 42.

Thank you for the image.  You are still not putting the required spaces in your command.
cp*satire/ is not all one word.
cp  means copy

means everything you see in the working directory
satire/ is where you want everything to be copied to

When you squish those three things together like you’ve done, it is not meaningful.
Put spaces in, put them exactly where the Step 3. example shows you.

Thank you a lot of!)))) I understand now, i  miss the space. It’s correct now

Try it with a Browser reset
++++   reset of session *****************
under certain circumstances you can shoot your Browser in an
inconsistent state.
Therefor it is of an advantage to know that you have 2 reset facilities:
One is the use of the F5-key which does a refresh Browser
and
Two, select&copy your code
Then use the Reset Code button of the course-window,
then paste your code back in.
Addendum
General Notes:
Always refresh the browser after making corrections:
CTRL f5 ( if on Windows or Linux)
CMD r ( if on a MAC).
CTRL 0 to reset browser zoom

Notice how you typed
echo “hello”
and the instructions it;s
echo “Hello”
something to do with a CAPITAL LETTER maybe? what do you think 

I solved the problem , It must be entered with a capital first letter
as here “Hello” ,

Have you seen this yet?

Yes i already tried it. Is trying it in other computer the only way?




 whoami06:

Yes i already tried it.


You say “it”, but there are several options there, I’m surprised that using the Alt combinations don’t work for you – that is the most popular solution.

I tried them all. This is what appears when I use the Alt combinations:
(arg: 126). And when I press space or other key it creates some space.

Unfortunately, I don’t have anything here to test on.
Which type of Linux do you use? Maybe some who uses a similar type will spot this question.

I use Ubuntu. Thanks for your help anyways, I will try in other computer,




 whoami06:

Ubuntu


This might help but I guess we’d need to look up the Unicode numbers.

How can I type ASCII characters like Alt + numpad in Windows?


shortcut-keys, unicode-entry, ascii

edit … trying to find an easy way to get the Unicode numbers.
This might do it: https://www.branah.com/unicode-converter.
Type the symbol that you want to convert in the top box and it will give you the Unicode number in the middle box.
So for a ~, that is ASCII 126, that converter gives us \u007e.
That means you should be able to type:
Control + Shift + U then 007e
@whoami06, if you get a chance to try this, let us know how it turns out for you.

Hi. First I would like to thank you for your time, you are awesome  Then, I tried all your options but none worked. I’ve been finishing the course in other computer so it’s all ok now. One more time, thank you for your time.

Hi Xddark999,

The touch command creates a new file inside the working directory. It takes in a filename as an argument
- Learn the Command Line > Navigation > touch

You type the command you want to run in the black box with the blinky white cursor (the command line ;)).
If that doesn’t answer your question, would you mind being a little more specific as to what you need help with?

Actually the touch command was really intended as a way to update timestamps on files.
Yes it can also create files, but that was its main purpose when it was created.

@kalyan_l,
######Have close look at
#biopic/notorius.txt
If you are traversing through the file-system
Always use
pwd  ==> where am i ??
ls -als ==> display all entities of this directory… file’s & directories & links etc…
If they ask you to copy or move some file
Always check if the file exists
#in the origin
ls -als biopic/
#is the destination accessable and what is there
ls -als historical/

Check your spelling in your command

I botched up the spelling of notorious and spelled it as notorius. Thanks.

There is some problem with your nano:
when you type nano~/.bash_profile, it says No such file or directory. But when you type nano hello.txt the text editor opens. Once it goes through using the nano bash cmd but later on it develops an error.
Also at the end using the source~/.bash_profile it goes through but when you repeat it again it develops an error such as no file or directory.n Good luck to other may you make it through…
","
@designsurfer59206,
Have you tried using a space character
like
nano  ~/.bash_profile 
source ~/.bash_profile

nano Open~/.bash_profile  is not in our lesson. It’s only nano~/.bash_profile.
However, using other simpler commands in the lesson will show the nano profile.

Ok if it is written correctly the 2. line should have already done the job. Maybe reset the page and try again or visit the different folders with cd and look with ls (list) what is inside of them in your case the cleopetra.txt file should be inside of historical.


996fa531c70ed0446b08414802cc52c6a40a4ada.jpg1366×768


i tried what you said but it does the same thing

Ok rereading the task you seem to be in the wrong folder. enter pwd (print working directory) to see in which folder you are, then go to the drama folder and from there you need to execute the cp command.
PS: could you post a link to the exercise?
PPS: in the 2 screenshot you list drama but you need to go to historical and list the stuff there.
PPPS: Sry for all the confusion your first approach wasn’t that bad but you wrote notorius instead of notorious… Also if this is a real shell you can use tab for auto completion which might come in handy to see if these files exist.

That is the expected behaviour of the cd command - it takes you to your home directory – UNLESS you tell it to take you somewhere else.
Are you trying to go to the parent directory of where you are now?

Yeah I was trying to go up one directory, it was completely user error. I was typing cd and it was giving me the error.

A common mistake is to actually type that.
Instead, you press and hold ctrl, then while still holding, you press o (the letter).
Do you think that is causing your problem?

A post was split to a new topic: I did opened the nano file the command saved there it doesn`t show up

Your answer helped me, thank you.
The confusion came from the instruction, “type Ctrl + O”
Then next instruction is clear “press Enter”.
How to know when to “type” by typing and when to “type” by pressing and holding keys?
Should Ctrl always treated as “press & hold” when coding?
I guess it is a newbie question and will pick up a sense along the way.

pwd : this means “print working directory”, it will print the name of the directory that you are in right now.

 ross_black:

pwd/home/ccuser/workspce will not talk command


That isn’t a valid command. What are trying to get the terminal to do?

maybe you should add spaces between the"" | ""and so on
so like this cat volcanoes.txt  | wc  |  cat  >  islands.txt

cat volcanoes.txt | wc | cat > islands.txt
maybe you should add spaces

You should use cd .. to move one folder up. If you want to navigate to drama/ using full path, then you have to write cd /home/worspace/.... Use pwd to see the full path if you want to use it.

I tried but still does not work  cd /home/worspace/drama/historical/ to drama/
What I should put after …
the bullet points?

Ok, navigate to historical/ and use pwd (print working directory) there. It will give you full path of your folder. Then just try to go back with either cd .. or full path pwd gave you (without the historical/ of course).
And after ... goes path that Codecademy gives you, but I’m not sure if it’s same or unique for everyone so I excluded it. Just used pwd to see the path you have. and try the methods I described here. If it doesn’t work, we’ll take another look into it and solve it.

How do you manage to get codes for step5 number4 vigate up one directory


I think I have already answered you in another thread, but here goes again:
cd ..


I do use cd but It still does not work.  Here my codes below.  What I am doing wrong?
$ cd drama/historical/cd drama/
This is what I get when I run it:  Use the change directory command to switch back to the drama/ directory.

Use the command

cd ..

It’s asking you type that rather than doing cd drama/
so type
cd ..

At certain point, it is unclear to me which directory you are at. Could you post an updated version with a ls and pwd command? For this step, you should be in:

you can see the current working directory with pwd

Hi @ctabacznyf ,
Try this to navigate to the drama/ directory …
$ cd drama

Then, once there, one of your choices for listing all the files and directories is …
$ ls

…and another is …
$ ls -al

Try `em both 

Here’s one more way to use cp.
Navigate up one directory from drama/historical/ to drama/.
How do I go upon doing this? thanks for all the help




 ctabacznyf:

Navigate up one directory


Whenever you want to change directories, you must use cd. To move up one directory, use the code for parent: ... Put those together and you get this:
cd ..

894,Cd.. doesn't work in this exercise,"Get Help,Command Line",,4,"
cd… doesn’t work in this exercise…you should probably do the exercise before you go trying to tell people what to do in it.
","
How come it does not work when I for one passed the exercise using it? cd .. is used to return one directory above from your current one. You can also navigate to specific folder if know it exist.
Free tip: you can write cd and start writing a letter, then pressing TAB and your folder name will automatically get finished for you (if it exists, computer will try to “guess” the folder name).
Example
// write this
cd dr
// press TAB
// it gets auto-finished to this
cd drama/


I have done the exercise, but not for a while, and although my solution may not work for this exercise it would normally work because you are going up one directory from what you’re currently sat it.
Drama/historical —> cd … —> Drama/




Manipulation lesson. 5/10

cd.. isn’t a valid command.
The correct command is:
cd ..

You can use cd .. to return one directory above where you currently are.
Example
// lets say you're here
C:\Users\Username>
// and you use cd .. here
C:\Users\Username> cd ..
// you will end up here
C:\Users>

The structure provided C:\folderName\anotherFolderName> is actually from Windows, and this course is for Unix based systems.
On Unix systems, it would be a bit different. On Codecademy you can see it is like this (if you execute pwd)
/home/ccuser/workspace/blog/someFolderName
// it can be something different depending on where you are currently located

Using cd .. would look like this on Unix systems
$ cd ..

You would write it after the $ sign.

Is this “Learn the command Line” valid even for Windows? If yes, does this teach how to deal with cmd.exe?

Not really.
You might prefer to use PowerShell over cmd.exe
The track uses Ubuntu (a gnu/linux distro) but applies to all unix-like systems (unix, solaris, bsd, mac, gnu/linux, others)
Windows is aimed more at point-and-click, so if you’re after a command-line interface then linux may be preferable. Any major linux distro will do, they use mostly the same things, varying mainly in how fast they are updated.
That said I’m sure you can get things done in Windows as well.

Basically what @ionatan said is no, it is not for Windows but it works on a variety of other things.

I’m stuck on wildcards 4, whenever I try to change directories through the command “cd action/” it gives me the text: “bash: cd: action: No such file or directory”.  Can someone please tell me what I’m doing wrong? (its saying for me to move up one directory by using the command “mv”).   :l

@courserunner03140,
If you are at $-prompt
do a pwd ( you will see where you are, in the directory-tree )
then do a ls -al ( all [output-lines] starting with a d are sub-directories )
Want they want achieve…
cd .. (you go UP in the directory-Tree )
cd directory-name/ ( you DOWN in the directory-Tree ) Only valid conform ls -al
ls -al ../ ( you get the file-pointers of the directory which is above-of the current pwd position )

@mahvishmi,
Please read…
= Im 14 and cant get past 11% cd jan/memory/ to cd .. 2015/feb/

type (cd …) and it will work, trust me I was stuck on this for a long time and i went to the glossary and found this and it worked, I was happy

I am still stuck on this.  What commands should I type to move up one directory from drama/historical/ to drama/, it says this is another way to use cp

Yea, but you first need to navigate before you can learn another way to use copy. To go up one directory use:
cd ..

whenever you need to move, cd is your friend (i made myself a cl command, really nice), but then we are going off topic

Yes, but cd is not working. What command am I supposed to use to navigate up one command?

@puedoc,
At the moment you are doing a course,
in which you will learn how to navigate on a =disk= within a file-system
in an Unix enviroment.
The file-system starts with a so-called root-directory.
This root-directory is the =top= of a directory-Tree
As this course is running in a =protected-environment=
our root directory will be /home
Unix-style commands are a little cryptical.
pwd parse/show-the-current-working-directory,
like
$ pwd
[output] /home/ccuser/workspace/blog
[visualized] 
/home
   |
   /ccuser
      |
      /workspace
          |
          /blog <<<Current-Directory 


With the ls command, you will get  =Listing= of the existing normal files,
like
$ ls
[output]
2014  2015  hardware.txt                                                                            


In the Unix-command environment you can use so-called =command-qualifiers=
which you indicate with a minus-sign -
Like the ls command has a
-a qualifier, which will cause the ls command to present =ALL= files in this directory
-l qualifier, the files are presented in the =LONG= format
$ ls -al
[ouput]

Im stuck when it’s asking me to go to SOURCE to activate the changes to the bash profile for the current session… What do i do ?
","
What is it about source you don’t understand ?
This is a help item from the great big WWW accessible thru your browser.
I quote
source is a bash shell built-in command that executes the content of the file passed as… blah blah blah
You can look it up yourself
If you go back in the course, it’s explained very clearly, in fact

This was not helpful.  i am having the same problem and trying to figure it out. there are many videos on how to succeed in the course but the best way is to try another day and it will work. i have tried that many times and i have solved the most difficult problems in all subjects.

What is not helpful about it ? Your statement is not very helpful to me in understanding why I’m not helpful to el144.
Have you tried a google search on the subject ?   As I said, the course itself explains “source” very clearly.
I also stated source is a built in shell command. Put those two together and you come up with the answer.
I think “Learn the command line” is one of the better free courses on this site.
There are 2 ways you can learn programming.
The lazy way - ask someone else for help on even the simplest things.
The intelligent way - do some research on the internet before asking your question.
I’d make a rough estimate that in 95% of the requests for help on these forums, the  answer could have been found on the internet without asking the question.
If english is not your first language, sure, no problem, I and anyone else can help with that.
However if you look at the original question… Well , do you need me to carry on ?

This course is a bit weird. I’m not really sure who it’s really aimed at. It pretty clearly moves/skips too fast for many complete beginners.
Entering
$ source ~/.bash_profile

runs script in the current shell. If this doesn’t really say anything to you, I wouldn’t worry about it unless you’re really interested. If you are actually interested it’s time to read guides, books etc. You’d normally use it for thing like loading variables stored in a different file into another script.
Here to put it simple and easy: It runs the script we wrote in a way that allows us to test the results right away.

I would just like to point out that nearly everyone here has used the “WWW” access the content that we are trying to learn. There is really no need to be snide and condescending to people that are attempting to learn new things and reach out to others for help. Either you can help or you cannot.

Please explain what you mean by ""condescending "" / “snide” in  my suggestions. The example I first quoted clearly explains what the term means.
Are you sure yourself that “nearly everyone” on here uses the world wide web to carry out basic research before asking the questions or are simply too lazy to find out for themselves ?
If you are sure, how do you know ? Have you carried out a user poll to find out ? Have you evaluated the ease of finding answers to the questions asked and evaluated the quality of the explanations against the complexity of the questions ?
If you haven’t, then start with this question and examine my answer and kindly explain how its “condescending”

Im sure you have already finished the Command line course and all but I think this is worth posting because I was hitting my head against the wall because I wasn’t able to make my source code plug threw…
The issue was that in the example it looks like source has no space before the tilde (~) “source~/.bash_profile”
the code simply wants you to put a space between source and the tilde like “source ~/.bash_profile”
I just completed this course today.

What output did you get? You might just have typed it incorrectly after all.

No output, there was only a red bar that said I got it wrong.

Did you delete the files? That would result in 0 matches.
Or, you typed it incorrectly, still seems very likely. Copy the command.

$ grep -R Arctic /home/ccuser/workspace/geography
/home/ccuser/workspace/geography/deserts.txt:Arctic Desert
/home/ccuser/workspace/geography/oceans.txt:Arctic Ocean
/home/ccuser/workspace/geography/uniq-deserts.txt:Arctic Desert
/home/ccuser/workspace/geography/continents.txt:Arctic Ocean
$

If you’ve changed something in that ubuntu instance, you can click the Get Help button in the bottom right, that  ought to reset the files.

Does that only reset the current exercise or all my progress?

The current and those that follow. I just tried it.
Or if they for whatever reason don’t, just create them in that directory with the text matches from my grep output above.

For the record, I still think you just typo’d it. Or at least, those who do are often completely blind to it so I really do have to suggest it a good 5 times or so.
It’s also the simplest explanation.

In the unit I’m learning about changing directory ‘cd’
I’m at 44% of Learning Commands

It’s asking me to change the directory but I don’t know what it wants me to change the directory to

You start in the /home/ccuser/workspace/blog (you can see this by running: pwd), then it wants you to go into 2015 directory, then in jan/memory/, and then on directory up (back to jan directory), so if you now would run pwd, it would show:
/home/ccuser/workspace/blog/2015/jan

these instructions are crucial:
Print the working directory again to see the new location. You need to use pwd command here which you learned in the previous exercise

Thank you but sorry I am still confused.

if you are stuck in step 3 simple write:
cd ..

note space between cd and …, in the assumption you are in the /home/ccuser/workspace/blog/2015/jan/memory directory

What browser OS do you use? For me CTRL+O then ENTER and CTRL+X to close works.

You have to press the combination CTRL + O, not type it into the terminal.

and than what because your suggestion does not update the progress…

If you press CTRL+X, it will ask you if you want to save before exit, say YES, then confirm the directory where you want to save the file.

FYI everyone, all you have to do is open the nano as stated in the first step, than on the second step do not open the nano interface, just type “Hello, I am nano.” into the base editor & hit enter (at the point the green arrow should illuminate) than follow the last two steps & your done.
let me know if you need a walk through as this step gave a major headache

WHENEVER I PREES THE ctrl + o COMMAND, IT POPS UP A WINDOW TO OPEN A FILE FROM MY DRIVE. IT DOESN’T GIVE ME THE OPTION TO SAVE A FILE.

Thats because you are typing command+O and not CTRL+O.

Then you probably need to focus the exercise instead of your browser maybe just click on the exercise.

I would agree. Sometimes it is a browser or window thing.  Try clicking away from the window and then try again.  I also use Sublime text and then I copy and paste into the browser window because of many issues with cntrl o snd v thang
Good Luck

This was the right answer in my case. I’m using mac, same thing was happening to me, but when I pressed “control” and not command, it worked

i had the same trouble at first but… tbf …i think that was more a case of it being due to me not really knowing what I was supposed to be doing… and so far i had just familiarised myself  to getting used to seeing mostly a black command window

523be2aed000e4d6511c91e106b112a9de6bf78b.png1366×768
 
I had not really taken note properly that in this lesson we were going to build on from the use of the black screen command window and incorporate ‘nano’ to utilise further provisions that become available to us
‘We’ll begin by learning to use a simple, command line text editor called nano’

ff9c8a8ef27e73bc739b0586d5e4f4a75ae8faf1.png1366×768

So, when the instructions indicate ‘this will opent the nano text editor’  tbh I failed to appreciate that at this point we were getting introduced to a similar command window
Ok nice but dim shud’ve named me Tim might be my nickname but don’t be too hard on me after all I am learning a new subject from scratch …right?

Anyway, slowly…get a move of speedy but surely, I eventually noticed…doh! the penny drops… that this time there is a bit more to the window at the bottom of screen and also notice it becomes more a black and white in this similar command window.

ec614e5767f02ff6d71c4e0b4c124c46a187cdb2.png1366×768

That said, even when I entered control (Ctrl) + (O) simultaneously, , I still didn’t notice the the white space line at the bottom of the command screen had changed slightly.

48a6bfe4bebefa874c2377a061bb7c1d8bfc5ef0.png1366×768

In fact, it took ages for me to realise this…tbh…as embarrassing as it was to say this,  I kept going back and restarting the lesson.  I even had a look in the forum to see if there was already anything posted about issues relating to struggling to get past this ctrl + O task!
Thankfully, after much persistence and happenstance, I noticed the slight change in the whitespace bar line at the bottom of the command window and finally realised I was actually doing as instructed

83775b71ea4948930ffca7ad698cfd4bdf5b3b0e.png1366×768

and then, just needed to simply go onto the next task in the lesson and hit enter followed by  ctrl + X.

9b7119a7fd0d6cb2ddeb388e768dbd0cea7c35b6.png1366×768

In hindsight…Oh how easy it is and how daft I felt not following those simple instructions …again …i put this down to being in unfamiliar territory so noticing these subtleties is not instinctive for me haha.

88f1b23da28b6480a5db06b115e603159037f433.png1366×768

Anyhoo… This, in turn led me back to seeing the familiar $ prompt I had become used to navigating with and was then able to enter clear that enabled me to complete the task.

208cb22761aeafb56b040a9c42a1d0e0bf4a96fb.png1366×768

I suppose when you are used working with a command window and undertaking tasks that have become routine it may seem strange that newcomers to the subject can’t quite grasp the instructions that for you, seem really clear.
And, well, yes, indeed, the instructions are clear but lest the creators forget, if someone is not at all familiar with the surroundings (just like when you visit a different place in the real world) it takes a bit of getting used to finding your bearings.
And, of course that saying about only being human plays a small role too - I admit I am prone to forgetting the earlier instructions even if I were just taught them as it often takes a me few times around the block practicing tasks before it really sinks in and then when the penny does finally drop, well, its like riding a bike or jumping in a car, I obviously go into auto pilot…
courtesy of ur pal …nbtscmt…nice but dim shud;ve called me Tim…haha.
These are just my observations and must admit I am glad we have this forum in which to post our issues whilst we continue with our learning,

Thank you for the help

it wants it changed to /2015/feb this one seems impossible no matter what I type.

i am confused:
pwd
/home/ccuser/workspace/blog
cd 2015
pwd
/home/ccuser/workspace/blog/2015
cd ..
pwd

Your last pwd outputs:
/home/ccuser/workspace/blog

right? cd .. will take you back to the parent directory, while if you are in 2015 you want to go to feb directory, to do this: cd directoryname
where directoryname is the name of the directory

@gigablaster46400, @stetim94,

938,How to correctly calculate the number of hard links in exercise 3.ls -l?,"Get Help,Command Line",,2,"

I’m a lil stumped on how the number of hard links were calculated in this exercise. In the exercise instructions especially no. 2 it says:
“This number counts the number of child directories and files. This number includes the parent directory link (…) and current directory link (.).”
Based on this, shouldn’t the no of hard links for the action directory be 6 including the action directory itself instead of 4 as listed below?

Task 1:

Change into the 2015/ directory again.

You are going to be changing directories so you know that you will need the cd command.
To use the cd command you also have to tell it which directory that you want to change to. To do that it helps if you know where your destination is in relation to where you are now.
Check to see if the 2015/ directory is a sub-directory of the one you are currently in.
ls

Do you see it? If you do, and I think you will, then you can use this to get there:

 javaslayer17165:

Here is a man page for grep:
http://ss64.com/bash/grep.html
Here are the parts we are interested in:
-R
-r
–recursive
Read all files under each directory, recursively; this is equivalent to the -d recurse option.
-l
–files-with-matches
Suppress normal output; instead print the name of each input file from which output would normally have been printed. The scanning will stop on the first match.
I think that -R is reasonably clear. l gives you just the file names that have search results. If you are a hands on type, then running some test grep commands with and without the l option will show you what it does.

Got it! cheers buddy!

You can use the
ls 

command.

to list all files in a directory, you will want to cd (change directory) to the directory of your choice. Then you can use ls which lists the normal files, ls -a this shows all of the files, even the ones hidden by a period. to list them all in a way that formats it nicely, ls -l, and to see the time it was last edited, you can use ls -t   , you can combine all 3 by saying ls -alt

I did “cd …” and it worked, but why?

It works because in the first lesson you page up (in directory) using cd …

… means “parent”
The directory above the one you are now is the parent.

be careful of spacing

What is your actual question?
With cd[space][name of directory] you change the directory. . is the name of the current directory and .. the name of the one above so cd .. would bring you to the directory that contains action/whereas cd.. cd .. something and cd ..something, to someting or just something will simply fail. cd ../action would be pointless but ok, meaning you are in action go on up and then go to the action directory there. Also mv and cp go like mv[space]sourceFile[space][target directory]. Where the  just indicate different parts and must not be written. Obviously after you moved something it’s no longer there, therefore you get the error on trying to mv superman.txt again or to just use the name. Hope this helps a bit.
At this point I’d press reset and just use cd super and then press tab for autocompletion

Is this the task that you are having trouble with:
Navigate to the drama/ directory.

hi albionsrefuge, I have a same problem on navigating up one directory from drama/historical/ to drama/.




 cssninja83842:

navigating up one directory


To navigate up one directory, you use the cd (change directory) command combined with … (parent), giving:
cd ..

It doesn’t work.
I wrote comand “cd” and directory several times, but everytime I get “bash cd: ****: No such file or directory”




 bumbledim:

“cd” and directory


I’m not sure exactly what you mean by that but, it should be
cd ..

That’s if you want to go up one directory.

literally type this:   cd …
finally figured it out after 15 minutes. also very helpful if you do it like twice then type Ls so it shows you what directories you have access to. Do that to help understand it instead of just saying “hey it worked lets continue”

yes i can’t move on to number 5 please help me

You should be using control - o, not command.

Do you just hold down ‘Control’ key and ‘O’ key at the same time? I can’t get it to work on my Mac either. Cheers!

Press and hold the control key.

It looks like you are doing the right thing with source  and your ~/.bash_profile has the right contents.
Sometimes the code checker in these exercises just doesn’t seem to be listening. We can try to poke at it a bit to wake it up.
Try each of these, one at a time, to see if you can get its attention:

reload/refresh the web page
use the “I want to restart this exercise” button under “Get Help”
go back one more exercise and try the restart again

To save the file:

you need to press and hold your control key
while you are still holding the control key, press the letter o key
let them both up now

It should then offer you a filename, just accept what it offers by pressing enter/return.
Now your file has been saved.
To exit nano:

press and hold the control key
while still holding the control key, press the X key
let them both up

You should now be out of nano and back at your command line $ prompt.

hey how do you do the symbol on windows that resembles a wave? before the /.bash ???thanks

Check your keyboard. Top left along the numbers key line.

thanks, i wasn’t looking properly and the main lights weren’t on in my room…It is like you said in the top left. On another note though, do you know by any chance how to modify my keyboard. There are a few keys that aren’t where they should be. Is there a way of re-adjusting my keyboard in a sense? I know it’s on a different topic to the original. but whilst I’m at it, i thought I’d ask. Thanks again…oh yes, I use Windows 7. Thanks again

Yes, definitely.  Search on the WWW. There are text templates you can download but then you have the problem of trying to remember which keys are which.  It’s a similar thing to gamers modifying keyboards to correspond to game controller actions.
Really, do yourself a favour and buy yourself one of those smart keyboards where you can pull out the caps and stick them somewhere else or some of the programmable keyboards. There are a plethora of options nowdays. Depends how much you want to spend.
Setting up keyboard templates is a bit like setting up hardware drivers. You’ll probably have to go into the setup menu  in Win7 and change things

If you have a  Linux machine, use VI to do the same thing.  If you don’t have a Linux machine, then do yourself a favour and get one. It’s far better than  floundering with this site and its idiosyncracies. Then get yourself some good material off the WWW and learn the command line on Linux. It’s not that difficult.

Have you tried with uppercase X ?  It should not make any difference normally, but then, this interface has lots of problems.

Sorry but none of it makes any sense to me.  I have never done anything IT related before.  I don@t understand how to change the directory to the 2015/feb/directory
Many thanks for your response.
John




 longjohn1975:

none of it makes any sense to me


You probably do know some things, like, you know that directories exist on your computer - yes?  You also likely know that inside a directory there might be other directories and there might also be files - yes?
When you are using a graphical user interface, like Explore in Windows or Finder on a Mac, you can click to change directories. In this course, there is no clicking, we will be typing commands for getting around our file system.
The first thing you need to know when you think about changing directories is that you can use the change directory command which is:
cd

If you just use it alone it will take you to your HOME directory. That is handy, but not what you want to do here.
To go somewhere besides HOME you’ll have to tell it where. You’ll have to give it the path to the directory you are heading for.
In that exercise, near the top, there is an explanation of how to use cd to get to the jan/memory directory. That is very similar to getting to the 2015/feb directory.

Many thanks for your detailed reply and I will try and continue with the excercise.  I do not understand all the terminology and it is like another language to me.  My cousin who is a Linux engineer put me on to this course as I am initerested in learning Linux too.
I appreciate your time and thanks very much again.

ls -alt

1.PNG906×254 4.46 KB

i can not find C in the bottom of the window, and it did not rolling to right or left.

That is a bit messed up. Is that using Edge as your browser?
Even if you can’t see it, it is likely that you could still use it, but why do you want to find the ^C option?

I don’t see the need to use the ^C option in “Learn the Command Line”. I finished it 100% and you never use it.
Oh, and the “^” button means use CTRL,  but CTRL + C will copy your highlighted text, and you don’t need to copy any text in “Learn the Command Line”. So, don’t worry about it pal.

Hello nsaguin, I recommend you provide the # and title of the exercise you are asking about because once you complete the exercise, you no longer see the % anymore (unless there’s a way I don’t know about).  However, I did some digging and found where you are, so…
Step 1:   cd comedy/
Step 2:   touch shrek.txt
Step 3:   cp * satire/
Step 4:   cd satire/
Step 4B: ls -l
Step 5:   cd action/
Step 5B: cd…/…/action/
Step 6:   cp m*.txt scifi/
Step 7:   cd scifi/
Step 7B: ls -l
I am pretty sure this will work. If it doesn’t, I can come back to it and see how to complete.  It’s easier to do when it’s fresh in your brain 

Thank you for your help.

Is this the step that you are stuck on:

How you do that is going to depend where the comedy directory is compared to where you are now.  Do you remember the ls command? Use that to find out if the comedy directory is in the directory that you are in now.

Don’t type the command on two lines. It only looks like it is on two lines because you are viewing on a screen that is small enough to make the line wrap.
You can grab the edge of the instruction pane and drag it to the right if you need to see it better:
