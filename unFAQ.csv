i am trying the lego piece challenge but i am unable to make it as it shown, i didn’t able to set the angles properly… please anybody help me with that!!!

        color=""red"" 
        position=""0 2 -5""
        rotation=""20 45 20"" 
        scale=""2 1 2""></a-box>

here is the code i am using…

having the same issue here, i’m trying to move the cylinder to fit the box

. I used this code and it appears similar like the lego piece.

I’m having the same problem. It is supposed to be on the box, but my cylinder is far behind it!

@beta1029425651 @laurentmisso26936928 @hrithikarya
Here’s the code:

  <head>
    <script src=""https://aframe.io/releases/1.0.4/aframe.min.js""></script>
  </head>
  <body>

      <a-box 
       color=""red"" 
       position=""0 2 -5""
       rotation=""0 45 45""
       scale=""2 1 2"">
        <a-cylinder position="".25 0 .25"" scale="".15 1.2 .15""></a-cylinder>
        <a-cylinder position=""-.25 0 -.25"" scale="".15 1.2 .15""></a-cylinder>
        <a-cylinder position=""-.25 0 .25"" scale="".15 1.2 .15""></a-cylinder>

There’s a supermedium discord server where a guy share this code with me. I highly recommend you joining in. He is using child-figures (something familiar to all of you because of knowing HTML) and same happens with a-frame.
If any of you guys have SO I recommend you posting it there, for future people having the same issue just googling for getting the solution. I still don’t have but I should sign up. Next time I will do it.
Happy coding and have a great day.
Edit: There’s also an Slack server and all this information you can find them on the documentation.
Here for example the section about HTML & Primitives: https://aframe.io/docs/1.0.0/introduction/html-and-primitives.html.

If you want to make the animation to don’t speed up at the end, use inside the animation the parameter “easing: linear”

To make multiple animation axis changes you can use the parameters “property: animation; from: 0 0 0; to: 0 360 0;”  (this example will make the object rotate in its y axis 360 degrees).

You can also instead of using an animation of 0.2 use a 3.2 one making it more realistic.

I completed the Building the Scene module but there seems to be a bug for the sound primitive. It wasn’t playing although the code is right (I got a green tick). When I inspected it, the error says three.js:42452 The AudioContext was not allowed to start. It must be resumed (or created) after a user gesture on the page. https://goo.gl/7K7WLu play @ three.js:42452 
Can you help me with this? Thank you.

Yes, I have the same issue. It cannot autoplay the sound clip.

Yeah, I’m trying to investigate into the noise.wav but the chrome-tab freezes every time I want to. I think the .html file is alright.

hey so the entire emojicode course is broken. 
the only way i can advance in this course is by directly copying the hint code (which is formatted IDENTICALLY to my hand written code) or by using the “View Solution” command.
this seems rather strange especially considering the large number of other bugs i have reported in the month i’ve been using this service. have any of these bugs i’ve reported even been addressed? i don’t know because i don’t receive any responses!

Hello there @mussarmusic!



 mussarmusic:

the only way i can advance in this course is by directly copying the hint code (which is formatted IDENTICALLY to my hand written code) or by using the “View Solution” command.


I’ve completed the Learn Emojicode course and I noticed this a couple of times as well. A workaround is to copy the emojis used in the instructions and paste it into the code editor. This allows your code to work while still giving you to opportunity to solve each step yourself.
P.S. 😀 is not the same as 😃. The first one is correct when using the 😀 ❗️ method.

Is there an efficient way of finding the emoji’s you need on the emoji keyboard? It took me a while to just find the emoji’s to wrap the print statement and the blue boxes. Had to finally resort to just copying and pasting the emoji from the instruction screen… 

Hello @blog2528865763 and welcome to the Codecademy Forums!
As mentioned in the lesson, an easy way to access the emoji keyboard is (Windows + .) on Windows and (Control + Command + space) on Mac.
For Windows, there are different tabs to access different categories of emojis (faces, objects, food, etc.) and one of those tabs is recently used emojis. The icon for that tab should look like a clock. The same goes for Mac in the frequently used section (icon is also a clock).

At the end it’s hard to tell which emoji is correct.
In Windows picker to tell these  apart is quite hard, and I don’t know how to pick the right  in Windows picker, I can only copy and paste yours.

Yep! I have a Windows computer as well and I still haven’t figured out which exclamation mark to use . The Windows emoji keyboard has a “Most recently used” tab for the latest emojis you’ve used, so you can use that to make sure you’re using the correct emojis.

Right now I’m in Linux and I couldn’t find a way to some key to put quickly my emoticons on command line. I had to stay with copy and paste. =(

Hi all,
I’m having problems with the emoji keyboard (which I got to via windows + full stop) where the correct emojis aren’t being recognised.  If I copy and paste from instructions it works.
Anyone else having this issue or is there a ‘user error’ I haven’t diagnosed?
Thanks,
Cherylynn

Hello @script0175611836 and welcome to the Codecademy Forums!
It seems that you’ve just used the wrong emojis. You used 😃 instead of 😀 (difference in the size of the eyes) and possibly ❗ instead of ❗️. They’re very similar but they make a big difference in the output. I still haven’t figured out the exclamation point, but a workaround for ❗️ is to copy and paste from the instructions rather than using the emoji keyboard on Windows.

book_1 = Book.query.get(12)

I am pretty sure this is the correct code but
The 3rd checkpoint still marks it as wrong.
Their error message is not even helpful.

Just wanted to point out a minor thing in case anyone else comes across it:
The code shown in the hint for step 4 reads:
public void OnGet(int? day)
{
  if (day.HasValue)
  {
    CurrentDay = day.Value;
    DisplaySteps = Days.Sum(d => d.Steps);
    DisplayMinutesExercise = Days.Sum(d => d.MinutesExercise);
    PercentProgressSteps = PercentProgress(DisplaySteps, idealSteps * Days.Count);
    PercentProgressMinutesExercise = PercentProgress(DisplayMinutesExercise, idealMinutesExercise * Days.Count);
  }
}

But - the logic for DisplaySteps and DisplayMinutesExercise are for when day does not have a value.
Instead it should be the code that was there to begin with:
  public void OnGet(int? day)
    {
      if(day.HasValue)
      {
        CurrentDay = day.Value; 
        DisplaySteps = Days[CurrentDay].Steps;
        DisplayMinutesExercise = Days[CurrentDay].MinutesExercise;
        PercentProgressSteps = PercentProgress(DisplaySteps, idealSteps);
        PercentProgressMinutesExercise = PercentProgress(DisplayMinutesExercise, idealMinutesExercise);
      }
}

This lesson is buggy (like a a lot of this course, honestly) but functional.
The tests all seem to be looking for an exact match - so if your tag order or white space isn’t exactly “right” the tests won’t pass.  I’ve filed a bug report about a similar issue earlier in the course, but haven’t seen any kind of reply.
If you are having trouble - you think your code is correct but the tests won’t pass, check the hints and make sure your code is character for character the same as what’s shown there.
If yours looks like this:
class=""blah blah"" />

but theirs looks like this:
class=""blah blah""/>

(or vice versa!)  - the test will fail.
Codecademy staff - this isn’t great.  Can you rewrite your tests so it’s testing functionality instead of character by character code?

This lesson seems to be broken.  Nothing I do will make test #3 pass, including copying in the solution code.
Wondering if anyone else has the same problem.

Weird bug in this exercise - doesn’t prevent you from solving it but, it looks like there’s an issue with the UN Date validation logic:

The Razor code seems to make sense though - wonder if it’s a conflict with frontend styling?  It’s not displayed according to the format specified, but it does seem to be getting validated again the format side, I’m assuming that’s what’s causing the error:

For the first part of the exercise (CountryStat.cs) you need to add a using statement or your code will compile.  Oddly, the test will still pass even if the complication fails.

Not sure why. Additionally, I can’t get Codecademy to check off the last step. I checked the solution and it seems the same.
