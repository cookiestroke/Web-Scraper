In the following SASS exercise, how does the code differentiate between the odd and even numbers?
width: if($i % 2 == 0, 300px, 350px);
margin-left: if($i % 2 == 0, 0px, 50px);
(https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-sass/lessons/functions-and-operations/exercises/if-vs-if?action=resume_content_item)
Thanks

The modulo operator ‘%’ is used to differentiate between odd and even numbers.
Every even number divided by 2 has a remainder equal to 0.
For example: 4 mod 2 = 0, and in code it works the same, but modulo has its own symbol ‘%’: 4 % 2 = 0.
Uneven numbers don’t have a remainder equal to 0, so e.g.: 5 % 2 = 1.
width: if($i % 2 == 0, 300px, 350px);

So, basically:
width: if( $condition, $value-if-true, $value-if-false);

Even numbers evaluate to true, and uneven to false.

I noticed that a certain order is required of the statements under .math{}, however the instructions did not really make that part clear. I would like to know a little more about what determines the correct order to list those statements.

1/2 or 1/12  1/12 is correct but in eercise “1/2”

does anyone else have problems with the parser to not read your answer properly even though you type it seemingly right word for word?

I type the exact same code and it gives me this error:

eacef43ee76bacff1a80b16df7883bf6e6e11db8.png1309×520 208 KB


Am having the same issue, did you resolve the issue. This is the second question doing this.

It’s obviously bugged. Garbage exercise that did not have any form of a testing process. I’m just gonna find another sass tutorial, like https://marksheet.io/sass-scss-less.html.

i also have similar problem…but i copy the exact solution then it show correct…

same here!
SERIOUSLY codecademy ??? YOU keep us learning and paying for this course???

I have recently experienced the same problem with this Sass nesting properties exercise: my scss code compiles correctly in css but I get an error message. People have been complaining for months about this bug and It is pretty unprofessional that it has not been fixed yet.


The bug everyone here talks about seems to have been fixed by now. The following code
.banner {
  border: {
    top: 4px solid black; 
    bottom: 4px solid black;
  }
  font-family: 'Pacifico', cursive;
  ...

didn’t return any error.

The tutorial’s example includes a CSS property called font-decoration. As far as I understand, there is no such property… It should be text-decoration. But then
.parent {
  font : {
    decoration: none;
  }
}

shouldn’t be compiled to
.parent {
  text-decoration: none;
}

or should it?

I don’t really see the merit of nesting properties.
border : {
    top: 4px solid black;
    bottom: 4px solid black;
}

doesn’t look much simpler than the equivalent CSS code of
border-top: 4px solid black;
border-bottom: 4px solid black;

especially if you write CSS properties in the alphabet order as Google recommends.
Do I miss something?

I think this lesson would be easier to understand if it were written as follows:
Mixins can take multiple arguments. If a mixin definition has a combination of arguments with and without a default value, you should define the ones with no default value first.
@mixin dashed-border($width, $color: #FFF) {
  border: {
    color: $color;
    width: $width;
    style: dashed;
  }
}

Sass allows you to explicitly define each argument in your @include statement.
//only passes non-default argument
span { 
  @include dashed-border(3px);
}
//passes both arguments 
p { 
  @include dashed-border(3px, green);
}

When values are explicitly specified you can send them out of order.
div {
  @include dashed-border(color: purple, width: 5px);
}

Mixins can be nested.

What does the “…” operator in “$stripe-properties…” do?

same question. Can we skip that 3 dots?

The same question occurs to me. So I’ve replicated the code on Codepen: https://codepen.io/masakudamatsu/pen/MNppvo
When I remove ..., I get an error message saying “Mixin stripes is missing argument $width-percent.”
$width-percent is the second argument for the stripes mixin.
It seems that without ... the variable $stripe-properties will be interpreted as the first argument for the stripes mixin.

I think I figured it out. The “…” works like the spread operator in JavaScript. It can be used to pass each list element as a different argument to a mixin.
In your codepen, $stripe-properties is a list with 4 elements. If you pass it without “…”, the list will indeed be passed as the first argument. But if you add “…”, you’ll spread its elements: the first element will be passed as the first element; the second element will be passed as the second argument; and so on.
You can check more in this post: https://scotch.io/tutorials/how-to-use-sass-mixins#toc-passing-arguments-to-mixins (see Variable Arguments Continued)
Hope it helps!

It said in this exercise that the keywords  through  and  to  are interchangeable in Sass. But when I tried and replaced the through keyword with to, I had to use $total+1 instead of $total to see the same result. why is that?

Apparently, the keywords through and to are NOT interchangeable in Sass.
With to, the iteration stops one step before the value specified after to.
This is useful if the list item index starts from zero, like JavaScript arrays. Then use to and specify the stopping value as the number of list items, all the list items, referenced with its index, will be covered in the loop.

you should only ever use a mixin if it takes an argument

Hello,
I don’t understand what this line means : “You can also surround a list with parentheses and create lists made up of lists.”
Could someone help me out, thanks alot!
Have a good day

Maurice Moss! 
The exercise shows this example of a list:
$standard-border: 4px solid black;

But sometimes we want to define values for “different occasions”. Let’s say that we want to use different borders for error messages, or for informative messages.
In situations like this we can define a list of lists:
$borders: (
  standard 2px solid black,
  error 4px double red,
  info 2px dotted blue
);

This will be introduced later in the course, but to make this example complete I have to note that we now can use this list to define different classes using a loop, like so:
@each $border in $borders {
  .border-#{nth($border, 1)} {
    border-width: nth($border, 2);
    border-style: nth($border, 3);
    border-color: nth($border, 4);
  }
}

This syntax is probably strange for you now, but these two snippets combined will result in this CSS code:
.border-standard {
  border-width: 2px;
  border-style: solid;
  border-color: black;
}

.border-error {
  border-width: 4px;
  border-style: double;
  border-color: red;
}

.border-info {
  border-width: 2px;
  border-style: dotted;
  border-color: blue;
}

That is an example of a list of lists in SASS 

IT Crowd fellow fan? 
Thanks alot for your help I understand now!
Have a great day!

You’re very welcome

When it says

Recall that, in CSS, a pseudo-element is used to style parts of an element, for example:



Styling the content ::before or ::after the content of an element.
Using a pseudo class such as :hover to set the properties of an element when the user’s mouse is touching the area of the element.


Is this referring to something in the last CSS section on Grids? I’ve been through the rest of ‘Introduction to HTML’ and ‘Learn CSS’ this week and I don’t recall anything about pseudo classes. (Unless I skimmed around it somewhere…?)

What is @include? Is this part of SASS syntax?

Okay, I realize that this will be answers in the following lessons. But that should be mentioned in the instruction…

https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-sass/lessons/mixins-and-parent-selector/exercises/parent-selector
Typo alert: psuedo should be pseudo

Is it possible to loop through each character to flip it?

Hi there, I’ve done a few steps in the The & Selector in Mixins chapter, but I’m not seeing any changes to the card visual on the right bottom corner.

Learn Sass   Codecademy1920×946 213 KB

This is the screen that I’m seeing.
Am I seeing what I’m supposed to be seeing in this exercise?
Because I’m not seeing any visual changes to the rectangle (nothing happens when I hover), I couldn’t see any effects with the “backface-visibility” CSS property that was incorporated to the code through the exercise.
By the way, I tried opening the same page in Chrome, Chrome Canary, Safari, and Firefox…but they all showed the same white plane rectangle with the overflown text (exactly the same look as on the above screenshot).

Why are we using such an ugly example?

I understood that with underscore, I can import sass files without compiling them to css file.
Does it mean that I can use every variables and mixins in the imported file, without compiling?
What can I do with partial, and what can’t I do comparing simple @import?
or May I have some specific examples or cases when I need to use @partials?

Hi @eugine01 ! For me , this was also not crystal-clear, but from what I gather these are two different situations:


We name our helper files (partials) with an underscore (Ex.: _variables) and put them in our project file. The underscore communicates that these files only exist to be referenced through an @import, and should not be copiled/compressed.


In order to reference what’s in our helper files (partials) - be it variables, mixins or whatnot - in our main.scss file, we need to use an @import, to explicit that we’ll be referencing code from that partial (helper file).


I don’t think there’s a @partials rule.
If I got it wrong, please let me know, as I’m also struggling with this explanation

I’m wondering if this is an error in this lesson. In the instructions, two code blocks are shown, one in Sass and one in CSS. The latter is supposed to be a “translation” of the former, but I think it’s missing something.
First, this block is shown:
.parent {
  color: blue;
  .child {
    font-size: 12px;
  }
}

Then the instructions say “The above SCSS would compile to the following, equivalent CSS:” and the following block is shown:
.parent {
  color: blue;
}

.parent .child {
    font-size: 12px;
}

But shouldn’t the second block actually look like this?:
.parent {
  color: blue;
}

.parent .child {
    **color: blue;**
    font-size: 12px;
}


No, because you are using .parent . child not only a .child. This what you wrote, you can use when you have .child only (without .parent) and then you have:
.parent {
color: blue;
}
.child {
color: blue;
font-size: 12px;
}
In .parent .child
the .child inherits from the .parent,
so instructions from CodeCademy are correct.

There are some bugs in this course, i follow the instructions but  it’s still wrong, when i ask the solution, the solution is identical than my response. Anyone know why ?

That sounds like a bug… you may just want to report it and move on.

oh ok, i already reported it, thanks you steven for your help (and your personal webpage is nice:grin:)

Awesome! That happens to me a fair bit too…
And yes, my personal website is muy bonita

I am getting the same bug 9 months later! I have reported it but terrible learning experience if you have to get the solution for the thing to work!

I’m having the same issue too!

Shouldn’t I see some change in my css file after finishing the excercise? It’s the same as in the beginning.
