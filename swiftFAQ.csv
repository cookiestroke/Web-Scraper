Forgive me, I think I am thinking too much. Can anyone explain to me as though I’m a child- on Omitting Argument Labels, we are learning about underscores in front of a parameter. This is what the lesson explains:

So far in this lesson, we’ve used parameter names in function calls thus using an  _  and omitting a parameter name is entirely optional. Many developers prefer this syntax because it:

Improves readability
Avoids repetition in the function call
Relates to how functions are called in various other programming languages


WHY do we write the parameter we use the underscore with if we are not calling it? Does it mean we CAN call or not call? If that’s the case, if there is NO underscore, does that mean we HAVE to call it? I’m super confused. I AM able to do the work, but I don’t get why.
Since I am asking… if you are an experienced coder, when do you feel as though you know enough you could actually take something and know fairly well how to implement? I love the way this is teaching it and the more times I reset and do-over, I am getting better and better, BUT if the lesson didn’t tell me what I needed, I would continue being that proverbial “deer in the headlights.”
Thanks!

What does the code look like when using .remove if you have more than one item to remove? I tried a comma and a semi-colon and it did not help. Thank you in advance.

while guess != magicNum {
guess = Int.random(in: 1…10)
magicNum = Int.random(in: 1…10)
print(“You guessed (guess), and the number was (magicNum).”)
}
The guided lessons says "" * Reassign  guess  to  Int.random(in: 1...10) .

Also reassign  magicNum  to  Int.random(in: 1...10) .

Note : if you don’t reassign  guess , you may end up in an infinite loop. ""
If the variables were assigned globally, why did they have to be restated in the while loop?

Bumping this up because I want to know, too.

honestly was staring at the screen confused because I was like what do they mean reassign if they’re already defined.




 ambermoore6119664730:

magicNum = Int.random(in: 1…10)


I don’t see the need for that line. The magic number should remain fixed, and only the guess would need to be changed in the loop.

Hello,
I solved the question by doing it a different way. They both print out the same response. I would just like to know the difference between my response and the response that codecademy gives. This is what I had come up with but it kept giving me an error but producing the correct answer.
for num in 1…9 {
// Add your code below 
if num % 2 == 0{
print(num)
}else{
continue
}
}
print(“Who do we appreciate?”)
print(“YOU!”)
edit
As I type this out I think I figured out that mine does it by looking if the remainder is 0 and if it is, it prints out the number. It seems that codecademys answer is if it has a remainder it skips it over and prints out the other numbers that are divisible by 2. I would just like confirmation about my thought process.

I’m glad you wrote because I am stumped. I feel like I missed something here. What you said in your edit makes sense–using your info with what I know, I’m hoping I won’t need to use their solution. I’ll come back and edit this if I have anything useful to say. Again, thanks!
Edit: We’re asked to look if the number is ODD, so regardless of correct answer after running, that’s what our code is to be focused on.
I’m still going to need to go over this a few times and do some research.
Good luck with the rest!

Is there any reason Codecademy would want to stop us from using large numbers? (I know that the initial number I put is one less than what causes an error from Python without additional code.)
I have used loops that run in the thousands to calculate pi and e before, and my computer was fine.

What’s happening? Is it not working in the “classroom?” Just curious–in case I run into the same issue. Thanks.
Also, to the Swift Codecademy staff, thanks for making witty lessons, so much more fun (and easy) to learn.

Still unclear why Switch is needed over an Else If. In the example with the cities, they seem to simply confirm you can do the same thing with Switch OR Else If. Any insight is appreciated.

I’ve got some confusion…
The lesson made me believe that using switch was INSTEAD of the else if, yet the only way to pass is for ALL of it to be used? And if this is true, then the next question I had was how the switch knew the expression was [Tony Stark]-but if it’s not true, then I’m unsure how switch figures this out, exactly.
So, is it switch OR else if or is it switch AND else if (and WHY, oh why???).

what is wrong with my code? Why I am getting 81 instead of 27 for the oddSum? Thanks
var list = [2, 4, 3, 6, 1, 9]
// Write your code below 
var evenNum: Int = 0
var oddSum: Int = 1
for item in list {
if item % 2 == 0 {
 evenNum += item

} else if item % 2 == 1 {
oddSum = item * item

}
}
print(evenNum, oddSum)
print (“Sum of even numbers is (evenNum)”)
print(“Product of odd numbers is (oddSum)”)

I think the error is in oddSum = item * item, it should be oddSum = oddsum * item or more simple oddSum *= item.

I also did it this way and it works.


var list = [2, 4, 3, 6, 1, 9]
// Write your code below 
var sum = 0
var product = 1
for item in list {
item % 2 == 0 ?
sum += item :
product *= item
}
print (“sum of even numbers is (sum)”)
print (“product of odd numbers is (product)”)
it turns out to be an error

Hi I am confused about exercise 2, where it was asked to compare midnight and date  to print a message,
how does it makes a difference if i have used date and midnight than midnight and date
let midnight = true 
let date = ""January 1, 2020""

// Write your code below 🎊

if midnight && date == ""January 1, 2020"" {
  print(""It's the start of a new decade!"")
}

VS
let midnight = true 
let date = ""January 1, 2020""

// Write your code below 🎊

if date == ""January 1, 2020"" && midnight {
  print(""It's the start of a new decade!"")
}

I had written my code as 2) but the script tool failed my attempts.

Hi! Just want to report a typo. Instruction on #3 : Finally, call the function with the following values for  seconds
‘seconds’ should be ‘avgSongLength’ because that is the name of the function we wrote in Instruction #1.

In the Challenge temperature, temp results in a lot of decimals, how can we choose that the result shows only 2 decimals?

I can do this in Python easily but can’t figure out the best way to do this in Swift. Any help?
star = “*”
for num in range(1,5):
starCount = “*” * num
print(starCount)

@microsolver41079
from the codecademy class earlier, they syntax for range is three dots
in order to print 4 lines I wrote:
in 1…4
so full thing
var star = “*”
for _ in 1…4 {
print(star)
star += “*”
}
check out Swift class on codecademy, you will find more.

I ended up combining 1st and 2nd exercise.
Is there a simpler way to determine odd and even numbers with prime marker?
I wonder if so many “if” is necessary or the sequence should be different to make it simpler.
//program for odd and even numbers with prime indicator
for num in 1…100 {
if num % 2 == 0 && num > 2 {
print(""(num) is even"")
} else if num == 1 || num % 3 == 0 && num > 3 || num % 5 == 0 && num > 5 || num % 7 == 0 && num > 7 {
print(""(num) is odd"")
} else if num == 2 {
print(""(num) is even and prime number"")
}else {
print(""(num) is odd and prime number"")
// div 1 and self
}
}

As for the second challenge,
why do we need “-1”  (minus one) in this line of code?
for num in 2…checkPrime - 1 {
Thanks!
// Second Challenge
// checkPrime can be changed to a positive number greater than 1
var checkPrime = 17
// Assume the number is prime until proven otherwise
var isPrime = true
for num in 2…checkPrime - 1 {
// If checkPrime is fully divisible by the current number it’s not a prime number
if checkPrime % num == 0 {
isPrime = false
break
}
}

The lessons says that two variables have been initialized. I thought villain wasn’t initialized? It doesn’t have an assigned value.
Sidenote: the Swift error messages seem quite friendly.

So, I’m confused as to why I have to input
villain = “Emperor Palapatine”
when I could just do
print (“Emperor Palapatine”). I don’t understand why we’d use the former and not the later. The later actually make the code work.  The ‘villain =’ doesn’t make the code work but the ‘Next’ but is all excited and says continue?

I definitely agree with the error messages.

Hi, I am fairly new to coding. I have seen a few other lines of swift code and wonder why print line, specifically in this one the  words are in parenthesis. Is this for a specific reason or when do we determine when and when to not place words in parenthesis?

Well, you probably already have the answer, but…
The parenthesis is the Swift syntax and would be used whenever you want to print.

Does Swift follow the “typical” order (from what I’ve heard)? That is, parentheses first (obviously), then NOT (I’d think it’s because it’s next to what it negates), then AND, and finally OR?

In lesson 6, the comment at the top says to make each variable true (but you’re supposed to make bool3 false!). However, there are two places in the lesson that say otherwise. I was able to achieve the correct solution, but it was still a bit confusing. This should be fixed.

I understand how && favors FALSE and || favors true but the below example page 6 of 7 ; makes no sense to me or when i would ever use this for an app? please help:
let bool1 = (true || false) || false || false
let bool2 = !true || (false && false || true)
let bool3 = !(false && true) && (false || false)

In Python, it’s not necessary to declare the type of variable before assigning it a value, but it is necessary in Swift.  In a line of code like this attached, it looks like there is an expression and then there are variables assigned.  Do we need to create an expression and then assign the variables within the expression in Swift?  The attached screenshot is an example of what I mean.
I really hope what I’m asking makes sense…


I’m a bit confused by adding Type to the variables. It is just good practice to specify the type of each variable? Or just for numbers? Seems kind of clunky. If you say “var height = 1.85” doesn’t Swift know that it’s a floating point number?
Also, do we always need to specify what type of answer Type we want? In this case the example explicitly states that “var BMI = Double”

If a switch statement actually checks against the values of the cases, then a where clause shouldn’t work since something like wholeNumber is not equal to let x where x % 2 == 0 (which I’d think would be a boolean). It must be more complicated than that. I know that it works, but I still wonder how it works. To be fair, items separated by commas are checked against individually, and you don’t check against a range, you check if the value is inside the range.

I literally did the exact same code
var learningToCode = true
if learningToCode {
print(“Don’t forget to take breaks! You got this ”)
}
idk the difference it keeps saying its wrong giving me a gray check
does anyone know why

The issue with this is double quotation marks. The compiler runs into issues when a user tries to include “Don’t forget to take breaks! You got this ” I have tried using \ "" but the compiler still gives an error even though it printed out correctly.
Edit: After viewing the solution, I am still confused as to why the solution works. I wrote the exact same thing.
var learningToCode = true
if learningToCode {
print(“Don’t forget to take breaks! You got this ”)
}

So I’ve been trying to learn Swift lately and I understand a very basic level of it. I tried to define a bool variable like this var learningToCode: Bool = true and it threw an error up in my console and I really don’t understand why I didn’t need the bool defined.

I didn’t understand too why we do not need space between { and if learningToCode.
that’s why it didn’t work out

This problem has not only NOT been resolved yet by Codecademy, but upon asking the editor to give me the solution so that I could continue, it proceeded to give me the solution for the NEXT task, not the current one.
Comparing the solution to the code I wrote, it seems the only difference was the variable declaration.
I wrote: var learningToCode: Bool = true
What was expected was var learningToCode = true
We should not be punished for using variable declaration syntax that was not only declared as correct, but actively encouraged in previous lessons - doubly so if the code was marked as correct on a previous step.

     2 3

Yes, that’s the one I was referring to.

Programmatically creating that visual pattern would take some work. The first step would be determine what the controls are.

right aligned with whitespace between numbers
one more number on each subsequent line than the previous
sequential number list.

Let’s examine this in Python.

.format() gives us alignment
range gives us a sequence

>>> row_count = 1
>>> sequence = [str(x) for x in range(1, 11)]
>>> while sequence:
  print (' '.join(sequence[0:row_count]))
  del sequence[0:row_count]
  row_count += 1

  
1
2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9 10
>>> 

That gives us our lines, now to right align them.
>>> row_count = 1
>>> sequence = [str(x) for x in range(1, 11)]
>>> while sequence:
  print (""{:>8}"".format(' '.join(sequence[0:row_count])))
  del sequence[0:row_count]
  row_count += 1

  
       1
     2 3
   4 5 6
7 8 9 10
>>> 

Figure out how to do that in Swift and Bob’s yer uncle.

What’s more, we have discovered another sequence, but one that requires a general term to describe it.
1 + 2 == 3
3 + 3 == 6
6 + 4 == 10
__ + _ == __

See the pattern, and where this is going? What if we can fill in the blanks with a program, well at least the last blank…
>>> def get_seq(rows):
	r = 1
	if rows <= r: return [r]
	s = 1
	a = 2
	while r < rows:
		s += a
		a += 1
		r += 1
	return list(range(1, s + 1))

>>> get_seq(4)
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
>>> get_seq(5)
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]
>>> 

Now let’s put this to the test…
>>> row = 1
>>> sequence = [str(x) for x in get_seq(5)]
>>> while sequence:
  print (""{:>14}"".format(' '.join(sequence[0:row])))
  del sequence[0:row]
  row += 1

  
             1
           2 3
         4 5 6
      7 8 9 10
11 12 13 14 15
>>> 


We do not need a list, when we come down to it since a range is iterable and sliceable…
>>> def get_seq(rows):
	r = 1
	if rows <= r: return [r]
	s = 1
	a = 2
	while r < rows:
		s += a
		a += 1
		r += 1
	return range(1, s + 1)

>>> row = 1
>>> sequence = [str(x) for x in get_seq(5)]
>>> while sequence:
  print (""{:>14}"".format(' '.join(sequence[0:row])))
  del sequence[0:row]
  row += 1

  
             1
           2 3
         4 5 6
      7 8 9 10
11 12 13 14 15
>>> 

To make this truly dynamic we need to know how much space is needed to print the last line for any number of rows. The following shows that we can insert a value dynamically in the syntax that denotes the space allocation in a format descriptor.
>>> row = 1
>>> sequence = [str(x) for x in get_seq(5)]
>>> while sequence:
  print (""{:>{z}}"".format(' '.join(sequence[0:row]), z=14))
  del sequence[0:row]
  row += 1

  
             1
           2 3
         4 5 6
      7 8 9 10
11 12 13 14 15
>>> 

Pay particular note to z in the above. It is at that point where we can perform a computation of the length of the last row. BRB

Into the logic for a dynamic solution we might have to bring in a utility…
>>> def count_rows(z):
	c = 0
	d = 1
	while z:
		z -= d
		d += 1
		c += 1
	return c

>>> count_rows(55)
10
>>> 

This is a function that can unwind the main function logic to arrive at the number of rows. z is the last value in a given sequence. This will give us a slice length to work with in the last line size problem. Something to keep working on…

With the number, 55 we got 10, and with that we have enough information to complete the size computation.
>>> sequence = [str(x) for x in get_seq(10)]
>>> len(' '.join(sequence[-10:]))
29
>>> 

We’re exploiting some pretty cool stuff, up to this point. Are we having fun yet?
P. S. Let us know when you port this over to Swift. The credit still belongs here.

>>> row = 1
>>> s = [str(x) for x in get_seq(10)]
>>> while s:
  print (""{:>{z}}"".format(' '.join(s[0:row]), z=len(' '.join(s[-10:]))))
  del s[0:row]
  row += 1

  
                            1
                          2 3
                        4 5 6
                     7 8 9 10
               11 12 13 14 15
            16 17 18 19 20 21
         22 23 24 25 26 27 28
      29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36
   37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45
46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55
>>> 

Think we’re getting somewhere…
>>> row = 1
>>> rows = 15
>>> seq = [str(x) for x in get_seq(rows)]
>>> z = len(' '.join(seq[-rows:]))
>>> while seq:
    print (""{:>{z}}"".format(' '.join(seq[0:row]), z=z))
    del seq[0:row]
    row += 1

                                             11 12 13 14 15
                                          16 17 18 19 20 21

                                 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45
                              46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55

We’re translating  from one scope to another with the z variable.

We have uncovered some very powerful stuff that may well apply to Swift. It may take a while to get up to speed, but along these lines one thinks t’would be worth it.
