1,"Oes a “chained” selector have a higher specificity than a class or id selector? For example, which selector would “win”: `.special` or `h1.special` or `#special`?","FAQ,CSS FAQ",,37,"
Question
Does a “chained” selector have a higher specificity than a class or id selector? For example, which selector would “win”: .special or h1.special or #special?
Answer
A chained or qualified selector has a higher specificity than a class selector but a lower specificity than the id selector. Hence, assuming these selectors are all targeting the same HTML tag,  the specificity from highest to lowest would be:
1) #special
2) h1.special
3) .special
","
It stated “if a p element also had a class of special the rule in the example would not style the paragraph element”. Why is this so and how to style p element then?

this post/topic is about resolving conflicting css property applied to the same element, lets start simple:
<p>i am red</p>

p {
    color: red;
}

the paragraph would be red, but what about:
<p>i am some color</p>

p {
    color: red;
}

p {
    color: aqua;
}

now what color will the paragraph be? the answer is: aqua
both selectors have the same specificity, so the latest styling gets applied.
Okay, what about:
<p class=""color"">i am some color</p>


.color {
    color: red;
}

p {
    color: aqua;
}

what color will the paragraph be? The answer: red
the class selector has a higher specificity, as such, that color is applied to the paragraph even though the p css selector is defined later.
finally:
<p class=""color"">i am some color</p>


.color {
    color: red;
}

p {
    color: aqua;
    font-size: 32px;
}


what font-size will the paragraph be? answer: 32px
the class selector doesn’t specify a font-size, so there is no conflicting property, so the font-size of p css selector simply gets applied

I am understanding how to style the paragraph but does the statement that i previously stated actually means that we cannot style two different elements(h2 and p) of same class(special)?




 meghataunk:

actually means that we cannot style two different elements(h2 and p) of same class(special)?


why not? Its perfectly possible:
<h2 class=""special"">some text</h2>
<p class=""special"">some text</p>

.special {
    color: red;
}

both h2 and p are red.
however, if you do:
h2.special {color: red;}

only h2 will be red, because h2.special selector rules mean: target all h2 element with class special. So h2 without class special are not affected by h2.special:
<h2 class=""special"">i am red</h2>
<h2>i am not</h2>
<p> class=""special"">me neither</p>

h2.special {color: red;}


¿Can you make a selector chainging two classes so that the css will only be apllied to an element that has both of the classes? For example, something like this:
CSS:
.note.italic {
font-color: red
}
So if we want to use this css and apply to an element, that element should have both classes (“note” and “italic”), otherwise, it won’t be apply.
Is there any way to make something similar to this? or you can only chain html elements with classes?
Thanks for the help.




 seamusspower:

Yes. When two selectors are chained (no whitespace) they become one selector.
<p class=""note""></p>
<p class=""italic""></p>
<p class=""note italic""></p>

Now consider:
<section>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p class=""italic""></p>
</section>
<section class=""note"">
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p class=""italic""></p>
</section>
<section>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p class=""italic""></p>
</section>

Now the selector will be a descendant…
section {}
p {}
.italic {}
.note {}
.note .italic {}    /* <<< this one <<< */

In my understanding,
Literally, higher specificity means more details, vice-versa, lower specificity means less details.
As tag has a wide range of affecting elements in HTML so It’s ‘not specific’ to indicate certain part in HTML,
Yet ID has a narrower range of affecting elements in HTML so It is ‘very specific’ to indicate certain part in HTML.
In this manner, If we look at those 3 examples shown above, #sepcial, h1.special, .special.
.special - cover all the elements which have class .special
h1.special - cover all the elements which must contain h1 tag and class .special
#special - cover very specific element with ID #special
SO order is #special - h1.special - .special




 jun_park:

#special - cover all the elements which must have ID #special


elements? Ids should be unique, so element.

Thanks for correction!
and Sorry for my bad English 

Why use
h2.destination  {
}
for the  h2 element if you can just label the class=“destination”  and use the following CSS selector:
.destination  {
}




 bjthomas1:

class=“destination”


may be applied to many elements, so a rule written for that would apply to all elements with the class.
h2.destination

is selective and will only apply to H2 elements that have the destination class.

i get that part but why even use an h2.destination when I can just use a class=""""?

Because then the class can only be used on H2.

i covered precisely this in a reply in this topic:



 stetim94:

why not? Its perfectly possible:
<h2 class=""special"">some text</h2>
<p class=""special"">some text</p>

.special {
    color: red;
}

both h2 and p are red.
however, if you do:
h2.special {color: red;}

only h2 will be red, because h2.special selector rules mean: target all h2 element with class special. So h2 without class special are not affected by h2.special :
<h2 class=""special"">i am red</h2>
<h2>i am not</h2>
<p> class=""special"">me neither</p>

h2.special {color: red;}




The example given was:
h1.special {
}
Then the article says: “The code above would select ONLY the h1  elements that have a class of special . If a p element also had a class of special , the rule in the example would not style the paragraph.”.
ANSWER: The chaining rule above has excluded the style application to the p element by marriage of the special class to the heading h1 element. Although it has the special class, p is NOT a heading but a paragraph element, remember. Now, as I emboldened in the lesson quote above, you even see that there are TWO conditions to be met in this “chaining” rule case:
1 - Be a h1 AND
2. Have the class special .
That’s why it says ""…the rule in the example would not style the paragraph.”…The heading h1 condition shut the door on the paragraph. In simpler words, the chain rule demands TWO conditions (1 & 2 above), only one of which is met by the paragraph element (condition 2).

Would it be correct to state that ID’s can also be used as chaining selectors in CSS?
eg: h3#destination

It would work, although unnecessary to write that way. There can only be one #destination, and chaining it to a type selector will have no bearing on the specificity.
<h3 id=""destination"">An id is all that's needed</h3>

A class is not confined to a single instance, or any particular type so can be chained to all manner of type selectors.
h3.special

p.special

ul.special

Chaining a class to a type is far more utilitarian than chaining an id, which is ultra-specific.




 bjthomas1:

why even use an h2.destination when I can just use a class=""""?


If in our particular exercise Top Vacation Spots we wanted ALL headings with class=""destination"" to be cursive, then I think you’re probably right to suggest that it would be cleaner, tidier, and more logical to just use the class as the CSS selector (as to add an h2 would be redundant).
However, in our particular exercise this is not the case. We have both <h2> and <h4> elements with class=""destination"" and I think the idea is that we only want the <h2>s to be cursive. So, as both @mtf and @stetim94 have illustrated in their posts, we need to chain our CSS selector so that it only applies to:



 mtf:

H2 elements that have the destination class.





 stetim94:

<h2 class=""special"">i am red</h2>
<h2>i am not</h2>
<p> class=""special"">me neither</p>

h2.special {color: red;}



If we substitute the <p> in @stetim94’s example with <h4> then this more closely mirrors what is going on with the headings in our particular exercise Top Vacation Spots (and obviously with cursive script rather than the colour red).
NB:  The <h4> headings in our exercise are the destinations in the unordered list at the bottom of the page.

2,Should we use flex-grow and flex-shrink instead of media queries?,"FAQ,CSS FAQ",q-a,1,"
Question
Should we use flex-grow and flex-shrink instead of media queries?
Answer
When using flexbox for a component(s) on a web page/web app, we should definitely try to make use of these flexbox properties instead of using media queries! Flexbox is responsive by default and flex-grow/flex-shrink may be better to use as there are usually less lines of code to write, specifically when using flex-grow/flex-shrink/flex-basis - as we can use the shorthand flex property in place of these three properties.  Unless we need a more specific behavior when our screens are a different width, we should try to use the properties built into flexbox.

3,Oval as a result of border-radius: 100%,"FAQ,CSS FAQ",,9,"
Question
why setting the radius of the #banner .content h1 border to 100%  gives me an oval and not a circle?
Answer
Having 100% on border-radius should give you a perfect circle, that is correct, only if the element’s height and width are the same. That is, you need a square element to have a circle border. As well, if your element does not have specific measurements it is at the mercy of the size of the container and its own content, and therefore you will need to adjust its measurements if your goal is to have a circle border.
","
Great answer! Thank you.

Setting the border-radius to 50% is sufficient to get an oval.

Thanks for the info bro.

Thanks for the answer.
I’m a little confused as to why the content is overflowing the border? Shouldn’t content be inside the border since border surrounds the content area (in case there’s no padding)?

because by default the overflow property is set to “visible” value and therefore the content is visible outside of the border
But if you set the overflow property to “hidden/scroll” value… then you will find that the content is confined within the border of the element

Hello, thanks for the answer, but still, text isn’t much visible. How I can put the text in the center of this cercle? I try with text-alight and margin-top, but all block change the place, not only the text inside.
Thank you!

I found  need to add :
#banner .content h1
{
display: flex;
align-items: center;
}

Hello, there!
Can I ask and interest?
Why when I try to create a border radius in my border box here  (at those #banner .content h1 selector) and want to create the Cyrcle border radius - it creates only an Oval? I try as it says that the border radius must be the same as width and height of your border box. Try to set also even the 100% too (not just in pixels). What maybe I can do wrong?
Thanks so much
"
4,Setting a border for one or two sides of the element,"FAQ,CSS FAQ",q-a,4,"
Question
Is it possible to set a border for one or two sides of the element?
Answer
Yes! Sometimes we want to make text look as if it has been underlined or sandwiched between two lines. It is not really possible through the border property but we can use its derivatives:

border-top

border-right

border-bottom

border-left


Each one of them follows the same value structure for border: width style color;
So, to have a white top and bottom lines on a paragraph tag that is 2 pixels wide, we would write something like this:

p{

border-top: 2px solid white;

border-bottom: 2px solid white;

}


and then you can see something like this:

Screen Shot 2018-09-27 at 12.41.21 PM.png729×71 1.29 KB

Note: There are other styles involved, but the main reason of this visual is for the borders.
","
Is there a specific order in which these designs have to come in, such as width, style, then color? Or is it able to be scrambled such as attributes for tags?

No There is no specific order to set this as we can set
style then color then width or as we want.

This is from the border style documentation available at MDN Web Docs:

The  border-style  property may be specified using one, two, three, or four values.

When  one  value is specified, it applies the same style to  all four sides .
When  two  values are specified, the first style applies to the  top and bottom , the second to the  left and right .
When  three  values are specified, the first style applies to the  top , the second to the  left and right , the third to the  bottom .
When  four  values are specified, the styles apply to the  top ,  right ,  bottom , and  left  in that order (clockwise).
Source:  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border-style#Values



Therefore, you can achieve your desired result by concatenating up to four values to the border-style css property.
If you want to set a border to just one side of the element, use four values (write none to the side you want no border to appear).
If you want to set a border to the top and bottom sides, use two values (write none to the second value).
If you want to set a border to the left and right, use three values (write none to the first and third values).
Example:
border-style: none solid none none;    // border will be applied only to the right side.
border-style: solid none;    // border will be applied only to the top and bottom sides.

5,Are padding and margin interchangeable?,"FAQ,CSS FAQ",q-a,11,"
Question
Can I use padding instead of margin to position an element?
Answer
Not always, even though they might seem to render similar results separating elements from one another, their main difference is that margin will create the space outside of the element, while padding constricts space inwards.
Here’s a visual example where the first element (red border) has received a padding property of 50px and the second (blue border) a margin property of 50px.

The space they occupy is the same, but the way it is occupied is different and that might make a difference in how your element is displayed.
","
Thanks for the info.

The padding is set, and there is text in the content box, and border is set.
If the height of the entire box is lessened, but padding is not changed, what happens to the text inside the box?

If the padding is set less than border nothing will happend to the text beacuse padding is the space between content and  the border it will adjust itself

e.g  see if padding is 200px
and border is 100px
the 200px of padding is inside the border of 100px
means it is 200px of 100px

If i set padding 200px what will the distribution among the
padding-top padding-left padding-bottom and padding-right
means it may be 50px or what

padding is used to separate content from the border right?  then in the case of no border applied? what is the size of the default solid  border?

can we use padding and border for images?
like if i want the corners of the image to be rounded how do i apply this?

I’m a newbie still, so I will happily be corrected by someone more experienced but… I believe in the case of borders the default size is to wrap the element entirely so it will form to the width/height of the content area.
If you were meaning what size is the border if we don’t specify a width?
If I recall from the lesson, a border’s default specs overall are:
width = medium
style = none
color = [element color]
So I believe:
p {border: solid}
would be the same as:
p {border: medium solid}
and in either case in your style.css it would have the browser render a solid medium border that is the color of the paragraph element.
With regard to the question about rounded pictures:
.avatar {
  background-image: url(""./Resources/Image/avatar.jpg"");
  background-size: cover;
  height: 50px;
  width: 50px;
  border-radius: 50%;
}

would make a circular avatar image similar to how our images show up in forum posts. I believe you can also set the border-radius to lower/higher percentages or adjust to pixels (px) to alter the rounded effect.

Thank you!! this really helped me alot

Anytime! I’m just glad I made sense to someone else!

6,"Is it possible for two selectors targeting the same element to have the same specificity? If so, which styles “win” out?","FAQ,CSS FAQ",,17,"
Question
Is it possible for two selectors targeting the same element to have the same specificity? If so, which styles “win” out?
Answer
Yes it is possible to have two selectors of the same specificity targeting the same element. For example, say we have this HTML element with two class names applied: <h3 class= “callout title”> … </h3>
Now the following rules use different selectors with the same specificity to target the same h3 element:
.callout {
    color: green;
}
.title {
    color: blue;
}

So which rule gets applied to our <h3> element? According to the levels of precedence specified by the cascade, the selector furthest down in our style sheet will win out. Hence, our <h3> text would be colored blue in this example.
","
So, what is exactly the answer to this question? I did not get it.

i made all the code better readable, please read the answer again. Let me know if you have further questions.

He implies that the selector which is in the last position (i.e.)the most bottom one will be applied. In this case  .title is at the most bottom, so text will be colored blue rather green. Hope you understood.

Yes, now that i applied the markup correctly, the post is readable, before, it wasn’t. Which is why farahadid didn’t understand it.
So yea, i assumed that now the post was readable, it would make sense, if not, i would have hard from farahadid.

I understood like this,
If you have studied language like C, you can imagine the same specificity in the way of altering variables. Among of those various codes of altering the value on a same variable, the last line changing the value of variable decides the value that the variable has in the end. Simply, It’s all about the order of command line.

so if i moved

.callout

below the

.title

then the color of h3 will change to green?

yes  the color will change to green  as  explained by  wuxi 

Taking the example at the beginning of the thread, what if the CSS remained the same, but the classes in the HTML were the other way around - title first, then callout.
Does it still go by the order off the stylesheet?


Yes. It still will receive the style specified by the last selector in order from top to bottom that refers to the html element specified. The order in which the class names appear in the element tag itself will make no difference. They still refer to the same element which receives the style. The classes aren’t styled, they just identify the element.

Thanks! I thought that was probably the case, but thought it was still worth asking.  

The operation priority is with lower “class” in CSS file.

it seems like that if you have two  classes e.g

and css rules
.green{
color: green;
}
.blue{
color: blue
}
the last css rule .blue will win

I read this MDN article about inheritance, cascade and specificity. However, when reading about specificity, I came across this table:
MDN-CSS-specificity-table1009×227 11.9 KB

I don’t understand why h1 + p::first-letter has a specificity of 0003. I would have thought it would be 0002 as h1 and p are both tag selectors.

Same thing with li > a[href*=""en-US""] > .inline-warning. I would have thought it would be 0012.
Can someone please explain why the selectors have the specificity that they do?

first-letter has a specificity of 0001 as well.
this table might help:
https://dev.to/emmabostian/css-specificity-1kca
this shows that attribute selectors ([]) also have a specificity of 0010
you can also reason backwards, if h1 is 0001, and p is 0001, then first-letter must also be worth 0001 specificity

Hi @samyadel,
I would also recommend @stetim94’s post to get more insight into how to calculate and find the specificity levels. Once you have that understanding and you want to check your work, other tools like specificity calculators might help you out.
In this case, you have 2 elements, h1 and p (each with a value of 0001). Then you have the ::first-letter which is called a pseudo element which also has a value of 0001.

Great! Thank you @realkennylin and @stetim94 for your explanations
"
7,Margin property with three values,"FAQ,CSS FAQ",q-a,3,"
Question
I tried giving margin three values and it worked, why?
Answer
As we know, the single declaration of margin can take one value and it will apply it to every side of the element; if we give it four different values, each one of them will relate to each side in clockwise order ( top, right, bottom left), and if we give the property two values CSS will account the first one to relate to top and bottom, and the second one to right and left. Yet, using three values works because CSS counts it as if the fourth value was the same as the second, therefore it is read as:
margin: top right/left bottom;
So, if we had  this for an element:
margin:50px 20px 1px;
Right and left will have a margin of 20px each, which can be illustrated like this:

","
can we use center value with margin
e.g
margin: center;

A margin surrounds a box, so it can only have top, bottom, left, and right. The center is what contains the element.

8,"What happens if we try to apply the same id to multiple elements? Will our styles not get applied to the targeted, ided elements?","FAQ,CSS FAQ",,11,"
Question
What happens if we try to apply the same id to multiple elements? Will our styles not get applied to the targeted, ided elements?
Answer
As HTML and CSS are designed to be very fault tolerant, most browsers will in fact apply the specified styles to all elements given the same id. However, this is considered bad practice as it defies the W3C spec.
Applying the same id to multiple elements is invalid HTML and should be avoided.
","
For that purpose we have class attributes, which may be distrbuted everywhere and anywhere.
The reason we can only have one id is because it is a fragment identifier that can be hooked with an HREF.
<div id=""history"">

</div>

and anywhere else in the same page,
<a href=""#history"">History</a>

Imagine the confusion over which one to hook if there is more than one id=""history"". The browser may always go to the first one in the page, though I’ve not tested this. Best to stick to the spec and write valid HTML.

Thank you very much for the reply @mtf! Very insightfull indeed.
Also in the next lesson it is explained another reason why not to use multiple “id”, which is because of the matter of Specificity of the elements. Using too many “id” can cause the document hard to edit in the future because it has a higher  priority when CSS rules are applied. I hope I got it right, hehe.

Specificity if something we should keep a tight rein on, keeping our document’s specificity as low as possible so that future changes to the page or site in general are not a massive undertaking, but a smooth transition.
style  id   class  type    # element
  0     0     0     1
  0     0     1     0
  0     1     0     0
  1     0     0     0

Higher specificity as we go left. The term priority is not really a common term in CSS. Specificity is an indication of importance of a selector.
p             element type
.class        element with class attribute
#id           element with id attribute
style         element with style attribute
!important    style property with !important override

specificity increases as we go down the list.

For example we have a 3 bdrm house, with no colors on the walls,.
So we gonna use class to make all walls white by default & we gonna use different id in that “house” so we can add different features for those white rooms ??? did I get it right?

what if if an HTML element has a class and an ID attribute? Wich has the priority? In lesson 9/17 in CSS setup and selectors, there’s an h1 element which has both. The class attribute tells the browser to make the content uppercase the ID attribute tells the browser to make it capitalize. In that case, after I added the ID, the content changed from uppercase to capitalized. It is normal?
If an ID attribute has a priority, why don’t we uses it all the time?




 robertoz7598688466:

If an ID attribute has a priority, why don’t we uses it all the time?


ID can only be used once in any document. There is greater importance, or specificity than a CLASS but for the most part we use it because of its uniqueness, not importance. In real truth we want our selectors to have the lowest possible specificity, not the other way around. That’s why TYPE has the lowest specificity… So it can be overridden.
We use class when we wish to identify a group of elements, of mixed type, and give them all properties they will have in common. Among them we may have a single element, typically a parent but not necessarily so, that we want to stand out from the rest, in which case we may give it an ID, but that wouldn’t be the only reason. Mainly our aim is make it unique from the others.

I have noticed that when I write id’s value inside single quotation marks (’ ') I get wrong message. Is it mandatory to write everything inside quotation marks ("" "")?

HTML purists from days of old would have nothing but double quotes on attributes. Netscape came around and all of a sudden there were single quotes on attributes (viewing page source). The purists didn’t yield. To this day we see double quotes on attributes in source requests. Maybe not always, but enough to deem significance.
Bottom line, it doesn’t matter. Let the purists have their own preference. (My preference is double quoted attributes, even in generated HTML.)




 mtf:

The reason we can only have one id is because it is a fragment identifier that can be hooked with an HREF.


Then why should we use two attribute in same tag whether we can use only one either class or id in h1 tag??

ID is meant as a global identifier. The fact that we can style with it is more a convenience than a rule. Styling with class is more the norm.
Essentially, there are two reasons to use ID, maybe three…

fragment identifier
unique parent container CSS selector
unique high specificity CSS selector

Bottom line, only use ID when there is a need to create a global hook that is bound to the window object.

9,Single declaration,"FAQ,CSS FAQ",q-a,1,"
Question
When should we use single declaration properties like padding and margin with values for every side?
Answer
The decision of how to structure  the padding or margin of an element will always be based on the needed result of a page, if you need to have different measurements on each side, a single declaration is easier and faster to write, the same goes for elements that have the same measurements on opposite sides, but if your element will only need the distance on one side, it makes better sense to use the property for that specific side, for example:
padding-bottom: 20px;.
",
10,Overflow in learn the box model lesson,"FAQ,CSS FAQ",,10,"
Question
In the introduction lesson, says to see how some of the properties affect the elements, and overflow is one of them, but what is Overflow?
Answer
Every element is a box, most often rectangular. But when one element becomes a container, i.e. it contains other elements inside it like a paragraph tag inside a div:

<div>

  <p> Here’s some text </p>

</div>


Then the container (also called parent element) might not always be large enough for the content and then we will need to decide how can we fix that issue. The overflow property helps us with that. It controls what happens to the content when, because of its size in relation to the parent element, it breaks the bounds.
The overflow property has three main values, the default is visible which will allow us to see the container inside of the parent element (also called child) spill over or overflow from the container, the second value is hidden which will hide the part of the child element that would not fit inside the parent, and the third is scroll, which will allow us to have the overflowing text hidden, and it will give us a scroll bar to be able to see it.

which will allow us to see the container inside of the parent element (also called child) spill over or overflow from the container


Is the word “container” in front of “inside of” a typo and was actually meant to be “content”?

Beautiful explanation, thanks.

oh i get it! but why would we want the overflow to be just hidden? It seems to me that scroll is the best option

The best option is the one that suits the design constraints. There is no fixed best option in the real sense, that’s why HTML/CSS is so flexible.

It is a typo for sure.

like zhangyil - I can’t think of a situation where one would want overflowing content to be not seen (hidden).Could you give an example of that?

There are other property you can add that when it is going to be hidden,  u add… for instance so that the user knows there are more stuff

Question
In CSS, can we select any HTML element by using it’s tag name as demonstrated in this exercise? Could I even create selectors to target HTML elements in the head of a document? For example, can I change the color of tab text with a title tag selector?
Answer
No. CSS is used to style our pages. As <head> tag content is not visible on the page itself, we can not target this metadata with tag selectors.
","
Good to know! Great question!

Agreed with coder_brewer. I always wondered that myself!

So how do you style you browser tab?

Whilst I’m only just learning CSS (and am relearning HTML as I haven’t done any in some time), as far as I know, you can’t style the tab text. It’s always uniform in all the browsers I use. You can add the little icon (don’t ask me how - been years since I last did it; hoping will learn again somewhere down the line!) but that’s about it.
Anyone with more knowledge, feel free to correct me if I’m wrong.

The way that makes style in HTML is useful for me, i have big hand :v

No. Not every tag, <head> Isn’t visible so you cannot Style The Head Selectors. 

The icon you are talking about is called a “favicon”: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Favicon .
You can add either of the following link elements in the  of your html file. You have a lot of other info on the wikipedia article, including file formats, size, etc.
<link rel=""shortcut icon"" type=""image/png"" href=""/favicon.png""/>
<link rel=""shortcut icon"" type=""image/png"" href=""http://example.com/favicon.png""/>

Good question  and thanks a lot for your answer

How do you know how to target specific paragraphs.  For example, in this exercise, you style the first paragraph and the first header.  How can you choose which specific paragraph in your HTML doc to style?

You can do this by assigning different classes to the p element itself, or to the containers that contain the p elements.
This covered in detail in future lessons.

you can go to the unicode characters and copy past little icons and place it in your 

Hello @nwhitton,
I don’t know if you’re referring to the fact that the other paragraphs weren’t styled. If you read the HTML code you will see that only the first and very last paragraphs are a p element, the rest are div elements, which is why they weren’t affected by the changes in the CSS doc. So to style each paragraph differently, you would have to asign a unique id/class.

can you style link color?

yes you can change the link colour!
And using it you can create an effect of changing the link colour after it is visited or when it is selected
code to refer:-
/* unvisited link */
a:link {
color: pink;
}
/* visited link */
a:visited {
color: green;
}
/* mouse over link */
a:hover {
color: red;
}
/* selected link */
a:active {
color: yellow;
}

Thanks, that helped.

12,When is it better to use visibility: hidden?,"FAQ,CSS FAQ",,17,"
Question
If display: none; completely disappears the element from the web page, why would we use visibility: hidden;?
Answer
The only advantage we may acquire by using visibility: hidden; over display: none; will be for layout purposes. If after having the value none on the display property, our web layout changes from what we want it or need it to be, then visibility: hidden; will be our best option. That said,  neither option is accessible to most screen readers, which allow the visually impaired to interact with web pages, therefore options, like positioning the element outside the boundaries of the screen and changing its opacity value to provide transparency, might be things worth exploring when thinking on inclusiveness.
","
After reading the answer, which is very clear in its intention and alternatives, I still don’t understand the conditions under as a developer you would want to use the visibility:hidden element to hide something but keep its space? Can you help me with an example that may help me?

@ pepeturo3023218952 : I just used the visibility: hidden property to solve an issue (which I explain  Here ).
–> However, I must advise you that I’m not sure that it was an appropriate way of using this property. <–

Does using display: none bring about the same results on code and visually as a comment element
(< ! - - comment- - >)?

it can be helpful for things like collapsing dropdowns and such. if you want transitions to work well, then using Visibility and pushing the elements off the screen can make it work better than simply Display.

neither part appears in the Document Object Model so it will not render at all, if that’s what you mean

One situation where using visibility: hidden may be “better”/preferred over using display:none is when you dynamically toggle an element’s visibility with JavaScript.
By toggling the visibility attribute, you will NOT cause a shift of the surrounding elements (mainly, if there is content below your element). The space the element held is still reserved in the page flow. If you toggle display instead, its space is released and the page will have to reflow.
For those curious, here are the two options in JavaScript to try out on an element in the middle of a page:
document.getElementById(""myElement"").style.visibility = ""hidden"";

and
document.getElementById(""myElement"").style.display = ""none"";


So what I am getting from these answers is that using the visibility: hidden will be good for keeping the page easier to load? I’ve also seen that it can be helpful to the visually impaired? These are very confusing to me unless the first thing I mentioned is true. How would this help a visually impaired person? Because the computer would still register that empty space in a reading out loud feature to the person that the option is there? Why is this good for only one type of person. If you are going through this much work to design the css… For the display… Why not just not include it? I feel thick-skulled and just can’t register the point. In the Code Academy lesson, the example they use is a  Donate  with CSS being .future { Visibility: hidden}. If someone wishes to have a donate option, why would they want it only to appear in the code for people who are visually impaired or a code reader reading the code of the page on their own… Wouldn’t they want the visual people to donate too? This example really proves confusing to me because donating would be an essential part of such a page. -Sincerely, dumbfounded coding amateur
        
Much like you tippiexd, I am very new to coding. The main reason I can think of that you might use the hidden property is for styling the page.
For example, if we had not yet set up the charity or JS for the donate button to link to, we may wish to hide it while the page is live, until we could resolve the link. Once we have resolved the link, when we make the button visible, the layout will not change as the space for the button was reserved in our original layout when we hid the button.
Hope this helps, it’s how I made sense of the “why?”.

For this particular exercise, why not use opacity since that has the same functionality as visibility? Also, opacity has a larger range of visibility, so shouldn’t developers lean more towards opacity more?

This is in my opinion, the best answer and I went ahead a clicked the ‘heart’ thing because this is quite a common sense answer that flashed through my head while reading the lesson/exercise.

Sorry Guyz … Still confused when to use visibility hidden as most of time we use display: none 

display: none;

removes the element from normal flow and collapses the remaining content to occupy that space.
visibility: hidden;

does not remove the element from normal flow, it only hides the container’s content from view. Nothing in the page is affected (there is no collapse).

Thanks a lot but can you please illustrate more examples of when we will preferably use Visibility?

It’s not about preference. It is about whether we wish to reserve screen space or not. Nobody likes content jumping about.

I’m just wondering why we would want to hide an element’s content from the page. I mean can’t we just omit it and not include the element from our HTML?

There are lots of scenarios but it boils down to waiting for user interaction. Drop down and fly out is built on the concept. The content is in the document but only visible once the user interacts.

13,This exercise illustrates how we can use multiple selectors to create more concise code. Are there additional tactics for creating less repetitive stylesheets?,"FAQ,CSS FAQ",,8,"
Question
This exercise illustrates how we can use multiple selectors to create more concise code. Are there additional tactics for creating less repetitive stylesheets?
Answer
Yes there are! One common way to keep our CSS concise is via proper utilization of “inheritance”. Within CSS, the computed values of many properties get inherited from ancestor elements. We can use this fact to reduce the number of declarations we write. For example, if I want most of the text on my page to be 20px I can declare font-size: 20px on the html selector. As <html> is the root element and the font-size property is inheritable, all text for this page will be 20px. In cases where we want to deviate from this 20px norm, we can use a selector with a higher specificty to target the element whose font-size we want to override.
","
on the style sheet would this be written:
html {
font-size: 20px
}
or
 {
   font-size: 20px
}
will this automatically link to the  code on the html page or do we have to add it as a class, id or other selector?




 ginagbradford:

will this automatically link to the code on the html page


Not automatically, we need a link element to import the style sheet.



 ginagbradford:

html {
font-size: 20px
}


It might be more appropriate to also include body in the selector list. That is where font-size will actually apply.
Be sure when writing CSS you always end each property declaration with a semi-colon.
html, body {
    font-size: 20px;
}

We can discuss this further, namely why we would not set an absolute font size on the body element.

another way is to use * symbol which applies the CSS code to each and every element in body.
like :-


{
font-family: Calibri;
}


this will change the whole document to Calibri.

I have a question about this exercise. In this exercise we used multiple selectors in order to change the font of P and h5 to georgia. Yet we already had a command to make P Arial. It’s the first rule of the css sheet: p {font-family: Arial;} . Does this mean that h5, p { font-family: Georgia;} overrides the previous code?

If one rule looks like,
p {
  font-family: Arial;
}

and further down the stylesheet we have a rule that looks like this,
h5, p {
  font-family: Georgia;
}

then the latter rule will definitely override the former, for all P-nodes. None of the paragraphs will be in Arial.
If the second rule looked like this, though,
section h5,
section p {
  font-family: Georgia;
}

then the first rule would hold as the general purpose font, and the second rule would apply only to P-nodes within a SECTION element.

What is the reason that a single selector for multiple unrelated elements overrides the respective element selectors?

p {
  margin: 0 0.5em;
}

A type selector rule is the least specific of all rules, and hence the most pervasive. Like water, it creeps everywhere.
We want type selectors to be the weakest, or least important so that we can build upon their foundation. In some cases that means making an alteration or two to suit a special need. The options are navigate (as in, traverse) to the target nodes, or give them a specific container, or give them a class. Purpose is the guiding force in this decision.
This is where the water begins to get murky. There is already evidence of a diversity of choices.
Consider,
p.class

  vs.

p .class

  vs.

.class p

To begin to answer your question we need to be certain that their differences and application purposes are clear.

Thanks.

Maybe this will help:

@font-face
The @font-face CSS at-rule specifies a custom font with which to display text; the font can be loaded from either a remote server or a locally-installed font on the user's own computer.






The video at the end of Review Visual Rules (end of this section) provides an example on how to use Google Fonts for our projects.  Skip to to min 5:38, Google Fonts, select the font by hitting the plus sign to the top right of the font.  This provided both the link to add to the HTML file as well as the CSS declaration for our CSS file.

Inside style.css, add the font family of the main heading ( h1 ) and subheading ( h2 ) to  Georgia .
This could be the most confusing sentence. Could this not have been typed as:
Inside style.css, add the font family: Georgia; to the main heading ( h1 ) and subheading ( h2).

This sounds like it would take up space on a user’s computer… or am I misunderstanding? Would the font automatically download? Would this slow down the user’s experience on a website?

If you use google fonts, it allows you to download specific font-families, but from my view so far, it seems like it takes up space on an individual’s computer if they were downloaded. (Not an excessive amount of space however)

Much thanks for coming to my rescue. What a twisted question that was. My brain was almost scattered as it went into nesting h2 inside of h1. Lord have mercy.
Another thing is whenever I am inside style.css, my code refuses to run without error until I refresh the entire page. At first in a simple solution at the very beginning of which I very sure of the answer to the question, I spent over half an hour not knowing what was wrong or where I had a typo. that was few days ago, I had to bring my problem here for help. The help and solution took another half an hour which I did not actually get an answer but through the process of going back and forth, I figured out the problem with style.css at run time. Nothing changes until page is refreshed.
Thanks again.
Now I know better, to simply refresh each I run or about to run my code.

Which is quicker to load? A webfonts font-face or directly from the computer with font-family?

Question
This exercise uses selectors that target elements which are direct children of parent elements. Can we similarly target more deeply nested elements?
Answer
Yes we can target deeply nested child elements. While we can target arbitrarily nested elements with the descendant selector, in practice we should aim to keep our selectors short.  As a very general rule of thumb, if our descendant selectors start to become greater than 3 levels deep we may want to consider ways to more specifically target the element in question. For example, perhaps we can throw a class on the targeted element instead of using a deeply nested selector.
","
In CSS, Which time should we set “h2.destination” or “.description h5”
These cases make me confused.


h2.destination will only apply to headers that have the class .destination.
.description h5 will apply to any h5 headers that are within any element that has the class .description.
Hope this helps.

So
h2.destination {
...
}

is for
<h2 class=""destination"">...</h2>

where h2 and “destination” are both specified within the tag
.description h5 {
...
}

this first is for all tags with  class=""description"" but only to the nested h5
(within that tag with description class)
for ex
<div class=""description""> 
  <h5>blah blah blah</h5>
</div>

.description li{
color: teal;
}
List items are nested, so I believe this is how they wanted. Try it and it will change the color to teal; if you try .description h5, it will not change the color. Look at the example

If I understand correctly…
h2.destination

is for targeting “within the tag”, the same element. E.g. an element h2 with class=“destination”
.description h5 

is for targeting nested elements (elements within other elements). Like soohyeok said, if say a div with class description contains h5 elements listed, e.g. a list of headings, you select the nested headings in this way.
Most times I just comfort myself: “In the beginning, the fathers (of these languages and their brothers the browsers and other platforms waiting to work with the code)  created all this jargon with their stated syntax, and we must dance their songs if we need their invention”.

would even

h5 .description

select the all the H5 nested under class=""description""
or is it not applicabel

 <div>
 <ul class=""description"">
 <li><h5>blah blah</h5></li>
 <li>blah blah blah</li>
 <li>blah blah blah</li>
 <li>blah blah blah</li>
 </ul>
 </div>


or h5 will only be selcted via

.description h5

thanks

The second example you gave is correct; .description h5 will be the one to select the h5 element in your example.
h5.description will not because it will be looking for a h5 element with a class of ‘description’, while your example has the h5 element nested within the ul element with class of ‘description’.

I’ve been coding since 82 and I’ve NEVER known the difference between these. This was one of the best things I’ve learned.  Makes total sense, but I’ve never heard about it before.

as I write .description h5 only h5 heading “top atractions” is in color teal. How to make all listed elements inside of h5 in teal too?

In the exercise only the title “top attractions” has an h5 tag, so if you wanted to select the list, you’d have to use
.description li
instead of
.description h5
This way you’ll see the list elements turn to teal.
This exercise was confusing because the lesson talks about nested elements and gives the example of a list. So it wasn’t super obvious when it asks to change h5, but it is indeed nested inside  …

According to CSS specificity, is:
.destination h5 > h5.destination
or
h5.description > .destination h5?
Thanks in advance!

Use the table to compute the specificity of a selector…
style     id     class     type

Given .destination h5, specificity is 1 in class column, 1 in type column, so, 0 0 1 1.
h5.destination also has one of each, so 0 0 1 1. That means they both have the same specificity. Their difference is in how they apply to child elements.
h5.destination

applies only to H5 with class attribute destination. H5 will not likely have any children apart from maybe SPAN.
.destination h5

applies to all H5 children of the parent element with class attribute destination
Even though their specificity is the same, the latter has much greater reach.

After reading all the replies I came to the following mind image. Please correct me if I am wrong. Its a mental picture that helped me make sense of it all.
Its code and its a machine reading it from top to bottom while executing it. So.
h2. destination - the machine looks for all h2 elements AND/with .class attached to it. For only those h2 matching the criteria will the style cursive be applied to.
.description h5 - the machine looks for all .class AND/with h5 in it. Only those .class h5 will the style color be applied to. So no other h5 in the entire HTML file nor all other text in the .description class will get the color teal applied to (unless otherwise specified as in a separate h5 tag in CSS)

So, here in that exercise, nested elements of li will be colored to teal only if we write in the CSS .description li {color=""teal}, but  if we write h5 li {}, will the nested elements under li be colored to teal? If not, what is the reason?

So why this is ok:
.description h5 {
}
but not this:
h5.description li {
}
Was stuck on the 1st part of the exercise then gave up and went for the explanation and saw the above - what gives? It’s confusing you’re given an example with li then you’re to figure out to put h5 in its stead…

Very well described example … Thanks!! 

How about if we want just one item in the list styled? Is it best to give that one list item a unique id? Or is there a way to target that one item using nested selection?

We can give it an id, yes, but as you have asked, is there a way to target one item? Yes, there is. It’s called traversal.
Given a UL, we can build a collection of the children…
ul>li

and then select which child you want…
ul>li:first-child

ul>li:nth-child(n)    /* n is an integer from 1 to N */

ul>li:last-child


https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes

There are a lot of approaches besides this one. I am a big fan of traversal and sparse use of ID. There is no hard and fast rule, so play with traversal and learn something that few people take the time to study.
Study the pseudo-classes closely. Above we mention n is an integer 1..N, but it can also be an expression that resolves to an integer.
2n + 1

and so on.

if I want to select li in this exercise how can I set my css selector? knowing that .description h5 li code is invalid

To set only the flex-basis and flex-shrink properties without specifying a flex-grow value as well, because we cannot set flex-shrink and flex-basis using two values for the flex property

17,0 auto value in Margin,"FAQ,CSS FAQ",,11,"
Question
How does auto actually know where the center is?
Answer
As we all have guessed, auto is for automatic, so when CSS reads it in a value, it adjusts the property automatically according to the surrounding space of the element (in the case of margin).  For example, having:
margin: 0 auto;
As we remember sets the four sides of the element in pairs, the first pair (top and bottom) will have zero margin while the second pair( right and left) will have an automatic margin which means that the width of our element (as well as the right and left measurements of padding and border, if any) will be subtracted from the container element’s width. The leftover space will be divided into two equal parts and assigned to the margin on the right and the left providing us with a horizontally centered element.
","
If I am following the explanation correctly, this means if I want to centre a box vertically, I should be able to do so by setting a height and then writing
margin: auto 0;
Is that correct, or did I misunderstand something?




 tewie3019:

margin: auto 0;
Is that correct, or did I misunderstand something?


Did you try it? In practice we seldom consider vertical centering unless we can be 100% certain the document will fit into the device viewport. Then, and only then might we devise a means of vertical centering by applying our own literal (not auto) margins or using position and offsets that can be calculated from the page height.

What would be a good practice trying to center vertically the h1 from the “banner” ID on the background image? I’d like something more practical (or standard compliant) than knowing that the background image height is 700px and coding my top: 300px.

Please provide some context. Do you have some markup and CSS for us to examine and reflect upon? Is this a lesson (if so post a link to it in a reply)?
As mentioned early, it’s not really a best practice concern, though there could be several other considerations to take into account. From the beginning of computers entering the mainstream, usability was at the forefront of concerns.
Designers want a view, users want to perform a task. How something looks can have a bearing in user’s selectivity. A good example would be the colors we use on buttons and where we place important page elements. A/B testing has been used extensively for decades to arrive at the level of usability the web has today. This is the stuff to learn, right now. From it you can determine if what you have in mind is something you might want to reconsider.
A bit oblique, I suppose, but it stresses how best practices are arrived at. For my purposes, best practice means writing well-formed HTML that validates; writing CSS that validates and seeks to be trim and slim; writing JS that does something important that CSS cannot do. In time you will discover from style guides and other documentation what are the biggest offenders and how to avoid them in your writing/coding. From this you will eventually arrive at your own list of best practices that may well overlap others’. There is some subjectivity, even in the objective pursuit.

Oh sure. It makes perfect sense, maybe I’m getting a bit ahead of my own level here and asking questions that only practicing a bit more can answer but I appreciate your feedback.
About my question, the white header is almost on the top of the box model (image) but I want it centered vertically on it. Lets suppose that we can ensure that the image will be displayed as we expect it to be, how can i vertically center in reference to the image?

#banner .content h1 {

It looks like I fell into a newbie trap there: I was carried away by the (seeming) brilliance of a purely rules-based deduction, rather than considering the practical need for the effect the piece of code has first.

Try playing with the top: property. Perhaps 250px.

That’s not true - in practice we often do want to center things vertically in web design.
It is an unfortunate anachronism of CSS that centering things vertically has historically been difficult, not that we don’t want to do it.
Advice for the OP: look up flexbox and use align-items: center;

I do not understand quite well why it needs to be lower than the width of the chunk parent in this case is body, plus, why when I put to a extremely lower width it goes to the right?

This is a late comment but, without playing with the code myself…
Does it always seem to align to the right regardless of the width of the element? Have you tried playing with the text-align property and centering it that way?
It looks like the <h1> is technically centered based on the output in the dev tools but I don’t know what the default text-alignment value is for CSS. I would imagine it’s left, but maybe it’s right???

18,Are margin and padding values the only ones that need reset?,"FAQ,CSS FAQ",,6,"
Question
Do I only need to reset margin and padding values to not be affected by the user agent stylesheets?
Answer
resetting margin and padding values either with the universal selector (*) or the body selector is the most common and minimalist reset. Most often for simple pages, it will work perfectly, so it can be the only properties that we may need to reset, but they might not be the only properties that we might want to reset.
For example: in Internet Explorer, buttons and inputs have a default overflow  value of hidden, but it is valuable to set it as visible and be able to address the overflow as we see it fit. Another example can be buttons, inputs, and textareas have different font styles on each browser. Giving them an inherit value to their font-family property and a 100% value to their font-size will equalize a base to implement our planned styles in those elements without differences provided by each user agent.
Presently, there are many ready-made reset CSS files out there, all worth exploring, but most often than not, when we are still learning… this:

 margin: 0;
  padding: 0;


either for the body or * selector, is more than enough reset.
","
If I want to reset everything in the <body> tag, couldn’t I just do like this:

body * {
margin: 0;
padding: 0;
}



{
margin: 0;
padding: 0;
}

The star in the code implies all HTML elements including the body.
body {
margin: 0;
padding: 0;
}
In this case however the CSS rules are to be applied to the body element only.
We use nested selectors to be more specific. For instance if we write
div p{
}
this implies the paragraph is a child of the div element. The nested selector in this case is equivalent to saying all the paragraphs in the div element.
But in your code the body is trying to nest all HTML elements. This  does not make sense since the body is a child of * (all HTML elements).

when we reset the user agent default values with the body selector. it doesn’t reset the classes or ids. how is that useful?




 script7480074801:

it doesn’t reset the classes or ids. how is that useful?


How is it useful to reset something one could have no idea of existing?
The only reason reset.css is useful is because it allows a lot of plug-ins and polyfills to play well together. It is not a magic bullet that we always need to apply. Personally, I’d rather dial in my CSS to override default styles as apply, without a blanket approach. It uses so much less resources and it’s pretty easy to follow along without making any assumptions.

An alternative approach to resetting CSS styles, is to normalize them (see, e.g., https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/). The idea of normalizing is that one doesn’t throw out all the default styling performed by browsers – as the default styling (apparently) can be quite useful. One only changes those default properties that differ among browsers.
Looking at the normalization stylesheet at https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/8.0.1/normalize.css, one, for example, sees that the body margin is reset, but the padding is not. Apparently, the browsers that were considered when creating this normalization stylesheet do already automatically set the padding of the body element to zero.

19,Why some elements don't have height and width?,"FAQ,CSS FAQ",,6,"
Question
Why do we need to set height and width, and why some elements don’t have it?
Answer
It is not always necessary to set a height and width. Elements by default are block elements and will have the same width as the container, and their height will vary depending on their content. The element’s measurements will be decided by what purpose we want it to have, just like news paper’s editors will arrange the columns, sometimes we will want to have an image that will only cover half of the screen, or even less. That is when we could use height and/or  width measurements.

What will be the result of a mobile screen, for example, if the content or padding overflows the screen? Will there be an effect on the visual performance of that particular website?

20,When should I nest flexboxes?,"FAQ,CSS FAQ",q-a,1,"
Question
When should I nest flexboxes?
Answer
We can use nested flexboxes when we require the content of one of our flex items to be easily aligned, ordered, spaced and/or scaled in a horizontal or vertical direction.
Imagine a hypothetical layout where we have a flex container (<section> element) with three flex items (<div> elements), where the last flex item contains some buttons that we want to align and space easily. In this situation we’ll want to use a nested flexbox where our third flex item is also a flex container:
HTML:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <meta charset=""utf-8"">
  <meta name=""viewport"" content=""width=device-width"">
  <title>My Site - Flexbox</title>
</head>
<body>
<section>
  <div></div>
  <div></div>
  <div class=""with-content"">
    <button>btn 1</button>
    <button>btn 2</button>
    <button>btn 3</button>
  </div>
</section>
</body>
</html>

CSS:
section {
  display: flex;
  border: 1px solid black;
  justify-content: space-between;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
}

div {
  width: 300px;
  height: 200px;
  border: 1px solid red;
}

.with-content {
  display: flex; /*will make our third flex item, within our `<section>` element, a flex container*/
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: space-around;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
}

",
21,Collapsing margins,"FAQ,CSS FAQ",q-a,17,"
Question
What is the reason behind collapsing on horizontal margins and not vertical?
Answer
First, lest address that the collapsing margins are the vertical margins, top and bottom margins, even though they are on the horizontal line of the element (if we go back to the box model) they take into account the window, which is the space where all the elements exist.
Let’s think of it as a grid of boxes. then top and bottom margins will be stacked up one on top of the other, thus being on a vertical line, the same way we can say that the left and right margins will always be one next to the other in a row (generally speaking), thus being placed on a horizontal line.
Now, the main reason why we can get collapsing margins on top/bottom values is that one of the rules for collapsing to happen is for an element to be a block type element. for example, if we have two divs together:
<div id=""one"" class=""div-one"">
</div>
<div id=""two"" class=""div-two""> 
</div>

they will both be by default block elements, which means they will be one, on top of the other, to make them visible (since they don’t have any content) this will be their css:
.div-one {
  height: 50px;
  background-color: papayawhip;
}

.div-two{
  height: 50px;
  background-color: cyan;
}

and we will see:

Screen Shot 2018-09-28 at 8.58.15 PM.png925×126 329 Bytes

Thus, if they both have top and bottom margins, we would have collapsing margins since they both are block elements.
So with the adjustment:
.div-one {
  height: 50px;
  background-color: papayawhip;
  margin-bottom: 20px;
}

.div-two{
  height: 50px;
  background-color: cyan;
  margin-top: 10px;
}

we will see:

Screen Shot 2018-09-28 at 9.02.33 PM.png926×143 2.77 KB

the bottom div’s (.div-two)  margin is still there, but it has become part of the overall margin of 20px.  This capacity of block elements (once we are aware) allows for an easier and cleaner separation between elements to be even.
It is not a quality of inline elements, and that is the main reason why there is no collapsing on vertical values, since having elements side to side can only be made by changing the way the element is displayed, from being a block element to an inline element:
.div-one {
  display: inline;
  background-color: papayawhip;
  padding: 50px; /*padding gives the inline div volume. Width and height do not apply. */
  margin-right: 20px; 
}

.div-two{
  display: inline;
  background-color: cyan;
  padding: 50px;
  margin-left: 10px;
}


leading to having to account for how we should manipulate our margins.

Hi!
What I do not understand is, why margins useful for us when we have padding, border, ect.   Why do we need an extra frame?  Also, when we create “something”,  how will it effect our eg: images? What does it do with it? What differences are noticeable? Sorry, I just do not understand …
Thank you.

Padding and margin are not the same thing. Margins will affect the size of an element in ways that constrain it, whereas padding will stretch an element to allow it.

There is no reason for collapsing; it is because someone thought it should be like that or mistakenly added such a thing.
Not everything require a justification. There exist norms for that reason.

it’s the other way around. They collapse vertically and not horizontally.
Margin Top and Bottom collapse. Margin left and right don’t.
from codecademy class:
“[…] top and bottom margins, also called vertical margins,  collapse , while top and bottom padding does not.”

Can you elaborate a bit? Are you saying that margin collapse was added as a kludge and it’s not required because you can do something like this instead?

I’m completely new to coding so I’m not sure if this answer is correct, but I was thinking this:
The width of a page is often predetermined to be a specific amount, while the height of a page may depend on your content and can continue as you’re scrolling down.
So for horizontal margins it may be most convenient to calculate exactly how everything will fit on the page simply by adding up the total sizes of each box. If boxes would collapse horizontally that might make the calculation less intuitive especially if you got many boxes, you have to think about which one is bigger and which one would collapse and so on, instead of just adding them all up.
Vertically on the other hand you may not really care how things line up exactly between the top and the bottom of the page since you can scroll down anyway… all you may care about is that there is a certain vertical margin between two elements, so you just set that margin on your element and if the other element’s margin is shorter thatone can just collapse into it. The collapsing can also help avoid extra unnecessary white space so you don’t have to scroll as much.

I like this.
Block elements in CSS treat the vertical and horizontal directions differently (a block element takes up a whole row, or horizontal end-to-end).
Your answer helped solidify my mental model that the vertical and horizontal directions should not be thought of as interchangeable.
For additional support, it’s a convention that you scroll up and down, and not side to side, although ‘from first principles’ there’s no reason it couldn’t be the other way around. But it’s not: apps are expected to have fixed horizontal space but not fixed vertical space. So it’s more important not to ‘mess with’ the horizontal direction–so, collapsing horizontal margins is a no-no.




 adamrgisom:

there’s no reason it couldn’t be the other way around.


… but the determination reached by the recommending bodies was to have DIV (block element) reach 100% of display port width. The content then unravels like tissue paper.

If we have two elements, one right after the other, is there any reason we should write both bottom-margin of the first element and top-margin of the second element since only one of them (the largest) is going to be represented?
Wouldn’t it be better to just specify one of them (the largest) since the shortest won’t have any effect?

It depends I think. If you’re sure these elements will always stay only aligned with each other like that then you don’t need to specify both. But for example if you remove one or add something in between in the future or if you got a dynamic website that changes based on user-input or device or browser-window or whatever, then it could be useful to have both margins.

Prevention is a good reason.

Lets understand this with an example, Suppose you  set a border to an element inn your html then,the padding rule will increase the distance between the border and your element. Whereas, if you use  the margin rule then it will increase the distance between your elements but the distance between the border of  your element and its content will  remain the  same.

This is the short and sweet way of getting the concept of how padding and border works to my mind. Thank you for expressing it.

Look at a typical personal blog site. Your explanation describes how words and pictures get placed/arranged in many of them perfectly.




 kingsam2619657558420:

Suppose you set a border to an element inn your html then,the padding rule will increase the distance between the border and your element.


Beg to differ. Padding is inside the content area, meaning inside the border. However, it is not between the border and the element. How can it be? It’s inside. But it does pad out the content area of the element. That means it will increase the height and/or width of the content area.
Margin is outside of the content area AND the border. When in a constrained parent element it will decrease the size of the content box height and/or width.

"
22,Does the order the of the <link> elements matter?,"FAQ,CSS FAQ",,3,"
Question
Does the order the of the <link> elements matter?
Answer
The order of <link> elements matters when we have conflicting CSS selectors - the linked resouce with the conflicting selector that is physically lower in the HTML document will be applied. This has to do with the concept of cascade; the order of CSS rules matters.
Say we have two CSS files with a conflicting selector:
stylesheetOne.css:
h1 {
  color: red;
}

stylesheetTwo.css:
h1 {
  color: green;
}

Given the following HTML, which color will be applied to the <h1> element?:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>My Site</title>
  <link rel=""stylesheet"" href=""stylesheetTwo.css"">
  <link rel=""stylesheet"" href=""stylesheetOne.css"">
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Hello World</h1>
</body>
</html>

The <h1> element will have the color: red; style applied because the stylesheetOne.css file is physically lower in our HTML document.

Question
How do we decide when to use flexbox?
Answer
When deciding whether to use flexbox or not we should consider a few things:

Can the scaling, spacing, alignment, or ordering issue be solved using more basic CSS? If so we should not use flexbox.
Do we want to use flexbox to create an entire page layout? If yes, consider using other CSS tools, like CSS Grid, in conjunction with flexbox - as flexbox is not designed to create entire page layouts.
Do we need an easy way to align, control spacing, scale, and/or order items in a vertical or horizontal direction within a container? Use flexbox!

Some common use cases for flexbox:

page navigation, including spacing items and stretching/shrinking items as desired
centering items easily
easily flipping content or switching the order of content

24,What is a pixel and is this the only measure of font size?,"FAQ,CSS FAQ",,10,"
Question
What is a pixel and is this the only measure of font size?
Answer
A pixel is one of several units of measure in web development. It is an absolute unit   equal to 1/96 of an inch.
Rems and ems are scalable typographic units which are commonly used with the font-size  property. As opposed to pixels, both of these units are relative. For example,  an em is measured relative to the font-size of an element. When dealing with ems it is important to realize that the font-size of an element is often inherited from an ancestor element. On the other hand, rems are determined based on the font-size of the html element. If font-size is not defined on the html element, the browser’s default font-size is used instead (usually 16px).
There are pros and cons of each unit but one major advantage of using relative units is that they lend themselves more naturally to responsive design. Relative units like ems and rems are flexible and scalable whereas pixels are not.
","



 wiki-bot:

the browser’s default font-size is used instead (usually 16px).


We can (and probably should) make an explicit declaration to adopt the browser’s default size at load time.
body {
    font-size: 100%;
}

Users with visual impairment often need larger fonts on everything and may set their browser to a size that suits them. The user is the most important person and by adopting the browser’s default and then making all our fonts relative to that we make the experience for those users appropriate to their needs.

@wiki-bot in your answer you said “an em is measured relative to the  font-size  of an element”.  Don’t fully understand this statement pls can anyone shed more light on this

<div style=""font-size: 24px"">
  <p>This text will be 24px, as inherited from the parent element</p>
  <p style=""font-size: 0.7em"">This text will be 70% of the parent size</p>
</div>

24 * 0.7  => ~17px

How to use ems and rems units, please?

can you put down more examples using the example of ems and rems separately.?
Thank You…

Their distinction comes from parentage. An em has a direct parent, the element that it is a child of. A rem has only one parent, the document body. I distinguish the two by thinking base for rems, and parent for ems.
Much like having a base font-family we have a base font-size. Because many users have larger font sizes as their system defaults, I always adopt the user’s base font size.
body {
    font-size: 100%;
}

From this point, using relative font sizing is a snap. We never need to use px unless we don’t want scaling. Even then there is no guarantee the browser won’t do its own scaling if the user zooms.
Given that the body is the super parent, we can give elements that we always want to be relative to it a rem unit value so no other parents or ancestors can intervene (in terms of relative measure).
Where these rules are assigned in the cascade will follow cascade rules. Create these selector rules close to the bottom of the cascade, with em rules written above them.

Aside
It follows that we would  never use the rem unit in a body selector rule. What sense would it make?
Another consideration is that <head> and <body> are optional, which means we would need to revert to the <html> directly. No problem,
html,
body {
    font-size: 100%;
}


To refute my own statement…
html {
    font-size: 100%;
}
body {
    font-size: 1rem;
}




 https://www.sitepoint.com/understanding-and-using-rem-units-in-css/:

26,Is flex-basis the same as setting width?,"FAQ,CSS FAQ",,16,"
Question
Is flex-basis the same as setting width?
Answer
It’s not! We can think of flex-basis as the width OR height (depending on flex-direction) of our flex items before they are constrained by a flex container.
Also, a few notes about using flex-basis and width/height:


flex-basis is limited by both max-width/max-height and min-width/min-height

When declared, flex-basis will override the width/height property set on a flex container
If no flex-basis is specified the default is the set width/height value, if width/height isn’t specified the default is the width/height of the content
When there is not enough space for our flex items our items will shrink at an even rate to fit within the container by default
If there is too much space we can declare flex-grow: 1; on our flex items to make them grow at an even rate

","
Whats the point in using flex-basis? Seems like we can just use width and height.

Flexbox Zombies


This flexbox zombies game is amazing for remembering flexbox!

As soon as you add a flex-grow property the basis becomes obsolete? At least in the excersise it doesnt do anything anymore.

The game link is not working 

Delayed answer but I think of flex-basis as “flex-when” or “flex-wait”, i.e. the values set for flex-grow and flex-shrink will WAIT to apply only WHEN the value for flex-basis is met.
e.g. .center-div {width: 200px; flex-basis: 100px; flex-shrink: 3}.
All flex-items will shrink proportionately until the width of .center-div reaches 100px, at which point it shrinks at 3 x the rate of the other flex-items. Can anyone confirm / refute this interpretation?

Eyeballing it I would concur that this is what happens too.

I agree, so it seems that once it hits the point of 100px, it will exponentially shrink at a rate of what you set for flex-shrink, which in this case, is 3.

Not exponentially, but buy the factor of the value you set. I get what you meant, though. Likewise with flex-grow.

@cakaragiannis    I doubt that. It really seems to behave exactly like the width property. I looked it up on the MDN documentations and on the resources posted by @tesla809. What I get is that we could define a width for a whole class of elements but then if we wanted a particular one to be different we could use the flex-basis property to give it a unique size since it overrides the width property. thoughts?

@ruronite
I see what you mean, but there are important differences:

Flex-basis only applies to flex-items, width does not.
Flex-basis takes priority over Width, which takes priority over the content’s computed width,
The Flex-basis value represents the ideal or hypothetical size of flex items before they are placed into a flex container that is too large or too small, at which point the elements will flex according to the available space, and the default or set values set for flex-shrink, flex-grow and flex-wrap, for example.

Here is a fairly good explanation: The difference between width and flex-basis

Here you go… https://geddski.teachable.com/p/flexbox-zombies

When I glanced through the question and answers that brought me to this page just to confirm what I practiced on, I must confess that my faith in @codecademy  was strengthened as I read @cakaragiannis detailed responses to the - flex-basis and set width.
He did NOT only answer question posed BUT dealt precisely on the  movement as per flex-grow/shrink behaviors relative to the given exercises.
Thanks my friend. I appreciate you.

incorrect syntax for selectors, e.g. class selectors begin with a period: .class-name

making sure each declaration block starts with an opening curly brace, {, and ends with a closing curly brace }

using correct syntax for CSS property names and values, ex: background-color: lightblue; not background color: light-blue;

separating property name from the value with a colon

30,Is CSS the main language used to style webpages?,"FAQ,CSS FAQ",q-a,5,"
Question
Is CSS the main language used to style webpages?
Answer
Yes!  CSS is the main language used to style webpages - we can style anything from fonts, colors, and layouts to transitions and animations.
","
follow up question, are there any others? And if so is there ever a real reason to use one of them instead of CSS?

Before CSS you had to style your page in your HTML.
<h1><font color=""red""> Chapter 1. </font></h1>

Notice how this is different from inline CSS
<h1 style=""color: red;""> Chapter 1. </h1>

To my knowledge there are no real alternatives to CSS, besides from some frameworks that were based on javascript, such as LESS. But they have to be transpiled into CSS before presenting it to the browser.
So basically CSS is the only way to go. In our current world, websites are based on HTML and are styled using CSS.

We can also use JavaScript for styling webpages but CSS is most commonly used.

True but Javascript falls back to CSS to do the actual styling  . You can’t live without CSS today…

31,How do I link my HTML and CSS?,"FAQ,CSS FAQ",q-a,14,"
Linking HTML and CSS can be tricky in your first few projects, and it’s not unusual to struggle a bit in getting it right.  Try including the following code in the head of your HTML project.
<link rel=""stylesheet"" href=""yourcssfilehere"">

With yourcssfilehere you need to instruct your browser on where to find the CSS file.  This could be an absolute link or a relative one (read more on the difference).  Typically your CSS file will be in a resources directory and css subdirectory.

Thank You

MDN is a good resource/documentation when it comes to html, css and JS

Thank you for the tutorial! However, I’m not entirely sure about what is written in the video. I think part of it is incorrect/not standard practice.

Using the following when adding an external CSS file is actually recommended against in the MDN:


type=“text/css”

The recommended action is to omit the attribute in this case.

In the boilerplate code, there is:


<!doctype html>

DOCTYPE should be all uppercase according to the MDN.

The boilerplate code has improper indentation. There is no indentation to be seen whatsoever, it has been skipped.

I think, while the code is technically “correct”, it does not follow standard. As this is part of a guide series, code should not just be technically sound, but follow standards as well, especially. At least, that is my opinion. I’m not entirely sure if I’m correct.
PS: Not sure why my username is as it is, as I have changed my username on the main Codecademy website as well.

Hello, I am using Sublime as the main editor and I would like to know if there is any way to add a plugin to have the file path copied automatically inside  Thank you!

what do you mean? The editor is to magically know which css file to include? Generally, when your project gets larger, you might have multiple css files, and you might want not to include all the stylesheets on all the pages. So i don’t think you will find a plugin for it
maybe a plugin which suggest files and directories while typing? that might exist.

I mean a way of copying the whole file path without having to copy it from Finder. it would be perfect if I could have folder/file.jpeg copied automatically when I have images inside the same project

Then my answer is still the same. You could use something like this:
https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ionutvmi.path-autocomplete
that is it. Often, you will have some many images, you don’t want to include them all.

type
This attribute is used to define the type of the content linked to. The value of the attribute should be a MIME type such as  text/html ,  text/css , and so on. The common use of this attribute is to define the type of stylesheet being referenced (such as  text/css ), but given that CSS is the only stylesheet language used on the web, not only is it possible to omit the  type  attribute, but is actually now recommended practice. It is also used on  rel=""preload""  link types, to make sure the browser only downloads file types that it supports.

With that quote from MDN, I would agree with you on the video being somewhat outdated in practice. However, HTML 5 has come to a point of being very forgiving language but this is not to say this isn’t something you should be familiar with or say that it is “incorrect/not standard practice.” MDN is just saying the CSS is a dominant stylesheet language, so it has become less relevant to denote “text/css.” MDN gives other examples on their site of how “type” may be used in other situations.

32,Min/max-width/height on text elements vs just font size,"FAQ,CSS FAQ",,10,"
Question
How can a range help on a text element if we have font-size?
Answer
It is not so much about it helping the size of the text, but the space it exists in.
A min and/or max value for width and/or height on text elements like an h1 or a p will provide the space restrictions for that text element to exist in the container, that way it oversees that either it is not going to be too small, or that it will not go over the space it should be contained in. The issue this may face is overflowing text if you have not assigned a font size in the case of an h# tag which has a default font-size of  2% of the window size. That is also why min-width, max-width, min-height, and max-height are more commonly implemented on img elements rather than text.

I have the same issue as the person above. I don’t see any effect in step 4 (setting max-height of the paragraph) of this exercise:

It may not be readily apparent until the page is loaded into a browser. If you can, create the page on your machine. Keep the image URLs so the images can be downloaded from the CDN.
Once you have the page saved, open it in a browser and shrink the width, then scroll up an down and look for any differences.

Yes, thank you. I see now that it does indeed work. But it is obvious only between the 3rd and 4th paragraph and only when the browser window is narrow. You can’t really see it in a full-width viewport. So, the example is not very illustrative and should perhaps be revised.

After:

After.PNG1078×634 33.2 KB


In the exercice 2 of the 12th page of the Box model why when we set the max width of the p element the paragraphs are no longer auto centered on the page ?

Elements in the page inherit text-align: center from #main. There is no center alignment with margin: 0 auto, only center alignment within the confines of its maximum width. The P’s will look like they are left aligned but if we look closely they still have the text-alignment inherited from main.

how do you know what size to set the min and max widths and heights?

In a responsive layout it depends upon the dimensions of the device in use (the client). We tailor our layouts to each device using CSS Media Queries.
There are two aspects to bear in mind,

device width
element width

For larger displays we might have two or more columns depending upon how our page is constrained. Some columns may have fixed widths, while one or more may have flexible width, given the device width to fill in. When columns get too wide to be easily readable, we can stipulate a max-width for that column so textual content is easy to read.
Bottom line, the values we choose will stem from all our own considerations derived from the chosen layout. It’s our design that dictates, accessibility and usability notwithstanding.

Question
Can I use margin: auto; on a flex item that is being positioned with justify-content declared on its parent flex container?
Answer
Yes! When using margin/margin-top/margin-right/margin-bottom/margin-left: auto; on a flex item we can easily position our flex item to one side of its parent flex container:
HTML:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>

  <meta name=""viewport"" content=""width=device-width"">
  <title>My Site - Flexbox</title>

  <div>2</div>
  <div>3</div>
  <div class=""four"">4</div>
</nav>
</body>
</html>

CSS:
nav {
  display: flex;
  border: 1px solid black;
}

div {
  width: 100px;
  height: 50px;
  border: 1px solid blue;
}

.four {
  margin-left: auto; /*.four <div>'s left margin will take up all available space, pushing the div all the way to the right end of the flex container*/
}

We can also center a flex item:
HTML:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <meta charset=""utf-8"">
  <meta name=""viewport"" content=""width=device-width"">
  <title>My Site - Flexbox</title>

CSS:
section {
  display: flex;
  border: 1px solid black;
  height: 300px; /*height added to show that `margin: auto;` will calculate both horizontal and vertical margins, if no height were added, `margin: auto;` would calculate horizontal margin*/
}

div {
  width: 100px;
  height: 50px;
  border: 1px solid blue;
  margin: auto; /*calculates `margin-top/bottom` and `margin-right/left` so the space is evenly distributed on top/bottom and left/right (respectively) of item*/

What is linear-gradient and why do we need three different background declarations?
Answer
linear-gradient() is a CSS function which creates a visual transition between two or more colors. This code snippet uses several fallback background properties for wider browser support. For example, older Chrome browsers might not be able to render the last background declaration but they might be able to render the declaration with the -webkit vendor prefix. Right now, the Opera Mini browser doesn’t support the linear-gradient() function at all. This browser would render the first background declaration.
Utilizing the cascade in this way allows developers to serve the latest CSS features to browsers that can render them while still creating presentable styling for browsers that can’t.

Question
What are the different methods to add styles to HTML?
Answer
There are a few different ways to add styles to our HTML.
We can link an external stylesheet in the <head> of our HTML with the <link> element, then add CSS rules to our external stylesheet:
<head>
  <title>My Site</title>
  <link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""style.css""/>
</head>

We can use an internal stylesheet in the <head> of our HTML using the <style> element, with CSS rules between the <style> tags:
<head>
  <title>My Site</title>
  <style>
    h1 {
      color: blue;
    }
  </style>
</head>

Finally, we can add inline styles on specific elements of our HTML using the style attribute with CSS declaration(s) for the value:
<h1 style=""color: blue; font-size: 48px;"">Hello world!</h1>

No. Page anchors are used to jump to a very specific region of a page. Specific regions    of a page should be uniquely identified with id attributes not class attributes.

42,What does the “cascading” in CSS mean?,"FAQ,CSS FAQ",,20,"
Question
What does the “cascading” in CSS mean?
Answer
The “cascading” in CSS refers to the fact that styling rules “cascade” down from several sources. This means that CSS has an inherent hierarchy and styles of a higher precedence will overwrite rules of a lower precedence.
For deeper explanations, please read the comments below.
","
“styles of a higher precedence will overwrite rules of a lower precedence.”
plz elaborate and explain

Picture a newly created element node that is nested within parent and grandparent elements. This node type will be HTMLElement. Every node can be seen to have a property sheet much like how a plain object has attributes and methods. At time of creation it is first populated with attributes inherited from its parent elements.
Now picture all the properties as being huge wall of pigeon hole bins, each bin representing a specific property, such as color or font-face or border, etc. Once the parent node inheritable properties have been distributed we turn to the style sheet. Think of each selector rule as being a separate package and give it to a runner who distributes all the properties in the pigeon holes. When a particular slot has a card in it that has equal or lower importance, it gets swapped out with the new one that just arrived, otherwise the new one is disposed of. Repeat this process with each selector and we see that last rule in is the one that applies.
Cascade refers only to rules we write directly to a node, not those that are inherited. Selectors are declarative and absolute. The order in which they appear in the style sheet has a bearing on how they will apply. That’s where importance comes in. As we said above, if the runner brings a rule with greater or equal importance, the new rule takes the place of the old one. The “equal” in that statement is important to understand, as that is when the last property declaration in as the one that applies is not tied to importance, only timing.

@meghataunk you’ll see this in action yourself in our CSS course, that’ll likely be the best way to understand this on a deeper level.  Roy’s description of how this works should prove to be very enlightening once you see a little more about how this works yourself, so if you don’t quite get it yet, bookmark Roy’s answer and come back later once you’ve seen some more examples.
For an illustrative analogy (and CSS doesn’t work this way per se but might help you as a beginner) imagine if I told a freelance designer that I’d just hired that I had some rules for the color of the headers in the design that I want.  Those are:

make the first header red
make the second header yellow
make all headers blue
make the third header green

These instructions conflict, so my designer might be confused and come back to me to ask for clarification.  Which one takes priority?  So let’s say that instead, I give the designer a sense of which instructions come first.

make the first header red
make the second header yellow
make all headers blue
make the third header green

Think of these as ranked in order of priority, so the higher listed things have a greater precedence and overrule those of a lower precedence (a “cascade”).  Thus, despite the third instruction saying make all headers blue, the top ranked instruction is to make the first header red, so the first header will be colored red. In this analogy, the first header would be red, the second yellow, and all other headers would be blue.  The fourth rule, to make the third header green, is overwritten by the third rule, which has a greater rank or precedence.
To think of it another way, think of how the Supreme Court can overrule the judgment of the Appeals Courts beneath it, which can overrule the judgment of District Courts beneath them, and so on and so forth.
Note that these analogies aren’t a precise description of how CSS works! Roy’s answer is way better for the details. CSS decides what takes priority based in part on how specific those rules are (for example, the fourth rule above was more specific than the third, talking about a particular header) and if you have other instructions like !important – listen to this rule first no matter what. CSS doesn’t come with an ordered list quite like my imaginary designer instructions.  Just take this as an analogy to understand how some rules override other rules.

Thanks! @oduffy i have got a clear picture of my problem statement with your answer. Also, thanks to @mtf for helping with the querry.

“The “cascading” in CSS refers to the fact that styling rules “cascade” down from several sources. This means that CSS has an inherent hierarchy and styles of a higher precedence will overwrite rules of a lower precedence.”
I second meghataunk-- you guys are really awesome at answering questions.  This helped me understand CSS a bit better.  I just need one clarification: which has higher precedence, an inline style put directly into index.html or one given by the style.css?  (Assuming they are attempting to style the same element.)




 rolandmoonstar:

which has higher precedence, an inline style put directly into index.html or one given by the style.css?


The inline, by far. The only thing with higher importance is !important on a CSS property declaration.
Inline style attributes have the highest specificity. 1 0 0 0. That’s not a number, but the values that would appear in the specificity table for that CSS rule.
style=""color: maroon""

Nothing in the style sheet can override that except,
color: red !important;

A specificity table is where we can enter a count of the selectors and their importance…
style  id  class  type

As we can see, type is the lowest when ranked from the right. A type selector has specificity, 0 0 0 1. This also applies to pseudo-elements (:before, :after, etc.).
A class selector overrides any type selector, regardless the count in that column. A 1 in the class column gives authority to override conflicting rules in the type column. Same applies with an id selector. A 1 in that column means it will override as necessary any selector rules laid down previously. Then it comes to the inline style attribute. That’s the kicker that can make one’s day, figuratively speaking.  When the only cure is !important then we know there is an inline style rule somewhere that is evading us.


Type vs Type Cascade
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang=""en"">
<head>
<meta charset=""UTF-8"">

div p {
  color: red;
}
p {

  <p style=""color: green"">This color rules!</p>
  <div>
    <p>Color me red.</p>
  </div>
  <p>Does this change color?</p>
</body>
</html>


Now substitute with this…
p {
  color: blue !important;
}



This was helpful and I appreciate. Thank you all.

Essentially CSS is all about rank (higher precedence). Like say in my family, there are some rules right? So if the parent has said one thing, and my sibling says another. I will go with what my parent said over what my sibling said. 

Thank You Soo Much Sir.!!

This was the best answer for a beginner, in my opinion…I love it when people come with their relatable analogies. Thanks!

this was an informative post




 mtf:

pseudo-elements (:before, :after, etc.).


what do you mean by pseudo elements before? after??

In Living Standard CSS (3 and above) the syntax is two colons, but in simple terms, a pseudo-element is one that is not hard coded into the markup.
<p>Hello World</p>

    p:before, p:after {
        content: url(earth_icon.png);
    }

    p::before, p::after {
        content: url(earth_icon.png);
    }

The elements are inserted into the DOM by the CSS. Check my syntax, it may be incorrect. The idea is to have a graphic on either side of the paragraph elment.
These elements have the same specificity as a type selector (p, div, etc.) which is the lowest as importance goes.
I recall a demonstration in the Chore Door project refactored topic from last fall.

This analogy was perfect.
I now understand precedence.
Thanks!

The style sheet has a beginning, and it has an end. A carefully crafted style sheet will follow cascade rules without messing around with specificity. It will let importance be the determining factor. Toss that idea around for awhile.

Question about the style sheet beginning and ending: do styles that come at the end (bottom) override those at the beginning (top)?

They will only if they have equal specificity.

The Example Page That is Shown on Introduction to Visual Rules…I have seen the code it directly conflicts with previous lesson (Semantic and Non-semantic Html structure)
Why There is Div’s Everywhere in that code, is it intentional? should we follow this style?

This is a common question. Best to just take it in stride and not try to draw any conclusions at this point. Forge on and learn to develop structure, regardless which block level elements you use.

43,Can we use flex-flow with a single value?,"FAQ,CSS FAQ",q-a,3,"
Question
Can we use flex-flow with a single value?
Answer
We can! flex-flow uses the following values:


flex-direction values including: row, column, row-reverse, column-reverse


flex-wrap values including: nowrap, wrap, wrap-reverse


flex-direction and flex-wrap values in a single line, no matter the order, for example: flex-flow: row wrap; or flex-flow: wrap row;


","
So in flex-flow or just flex, the order of properties wouldn’t matter?

I figured no because:
flex is used to specify flex-grow , flex-shrink , and flex-basis in one declaration.
In this declaration the first two values(flex-grow , flex-shrink) use integers  (i.e. 1, 2 or 3) to indicate the proportion they either grow or shrink. Integers are not unique and therefore the positioning in the ‘flex’ decalaration is important(mandatory)
Whereas:
flex-flow is used to specify flex-wrap and flex-direction in one declaration.
In the ‘flex-flow’ declaration the values are unique for both ‘flex-wrap’(values: nowrap , wrap , wrap-reverse) and ‘flex-direction’(values: row , column , row-reverse , column-reverse). And therefore their order in the declaration does not matter.
Plz correct me if i’m wrong thnx!

44,Can you apply multiple stylesheets to a single page?,"FAQ,CSS FAQ",,6,"
Question
In the context of this exercise, can we apply multiple stylesheets to a single page?
Answer
Yes, you can apply more than one stylesheet to an HTML file.
For each stylesheet you link to a page, you would just need to add an additional <link> element. Like so,
<link href=""style1.css"" rel=""stylesheet"">
<link href=""style2.css"" rel=""stylesheet"">
...

However, when applying more than one stylesheet to your page, there are a few things you may want to keep in mind.
When linking multiple CSS files, the styles are applied in the order that they are linked in the HTML document. So, in the above code, all the rules from style1.css would be applied first, then the rules from style2.css will be applied. This can cause similar rules to overwrite the rules from the previously linked files.
In addition, linking too many files, in general, can affect the performance of a webpage, since each file must be loaded into the browser. More files will mean that more of them must be transferred and loaded from the server, which can slow down the loading time.

Probably just trying to optimize a single style sheet as much as you can

I am confused . When it comes to overwriting rules, does it mean that in the code above rules from style2.css will overwrite the similar rules which were indicated before in style1.css? Or will style1.css still be dominant?

Since style1.css would run first, I believe style2.css would then overwrite any similar rules as it is applied next.

thank you very much for making it clear

45,What happens if I have both a background-color and background-image?,"FAQ,CSS FAQ",,21,"
Question
What happens if I have both a background-color and background-image property on the same element?
Answer
When we have both a background-color and background-image property applied to the same element, whichever property that is physically lower in the CSS file will be applied.   In the example code our background-image property is physically lower in the CSS file and will be rendered to the page instead of the background-image property.  If however, the background-image URL value fails to load, the background-color property will be applied instead.
Example:
HTML:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>My Site</title>
</head>
<body>
  <div>
    <h1>Hello World</h1>
  </div>
</body>
</html>

CSS:
div {
  height: 200px;
  width: 200px;
  color: white;
  background-color: rebeccapurple;
  background-image: url('https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1535544320549-1d65b9d3d9d7');
  background-size: cover;
}

","
There is a typing error in 2nd sentence, you meant"" In the example code our  background-colour  property is physically lower in the CSS file and will be rendered to the page instead of the  background-image  property.? right?

Position in the physical file applies to selector rules only, not the declaration blocks. They are object like and have no order.
To experiment and see for yourself what happens, comment out or remove the background-color property and create a new selector rule with the same selector.
div {
    background-color: rebeccapurple;
}

Write that rule AFTER the one in your post above, and save. Refresh the page. What do you see? Background color, only?

Hi,
I came to this topic from a link in “A Closer Look at CSS” lesson of the “Make a Website” course. I think @aubsrey’s answer is incorrect. Within a rule, it doesn’t seem to matter if you have background-color or background-image first. background-image, if it loads successfully, overrides the background-color.
In fact, it doesn’t even matter if you try to override the background image by placing background-color into the inline CSS of a specific element. background-image still displays. This is not surprising, because W3C states:

The color is drawn behind any background images

I hope this helps anyone.

In the days of the browser wars browsers were often quirky so it was common to see ‘rule of thumb’ type recommendations come up in the community.
color
background-color
background-image

was the order of the day. Today’s browsers tend to conform better to recommendations and more vendors adhere to the specs. Many of the old rules have fallen away.

I am completely lost in this section as whatever answer I gave did not run in the CSS even when the correction or solution is given, I see no difference. So frustrating.

May be this very class is not for me or something wrong with the main.CSS.
When I ask for help in just one question, the rest of then answers get supplied and I wonder how then I can progress.

We will need to see your markup and style sheet to be able to draw any conclusions. Please post the code in a reply.

I was only supposed to change 32px to 48px; yet it did not run but kept asking if I had changed the value to 48px.
it started with change the color of the font to red, I did for over 20 mins but it would not run, when I got tired and asked for one solution, I got the entire solution given. so sad.

46,Why do we use maximum width 100% to see a full image and not minimum width?,"FAQ,CSS FAQ",,18,"
In this exercise, why does changing the .image container img rule’s maximum width to 100%, ensure that the entire image is always seen.
How does changing the maximum scaling width change how the picture scales? If anything, I would’ve thought minimum width at 100% would force the entire image to be seen. I don’t entirely understand how this interaction works.
","
When scaling the width of an img to 100%, it is the parent container width that it is scaled to. We do not set the height in this case, only the width. The picture will expand to fit the parent to any size. It may overflow at the bottom after a certain width.
BTW, please post a link to the exercise so we can read the lesson text and give this question some context.

Hi,
This is the exercise: https://www.codecademy.com/paths/web-development/tracks/getting-more-advanced-with-design/modules/learn-responsive-design-module/lessons/sizing-elements/exercises/scaling-img-video
I’ve got the same exact doubt, but somehow your answer does not do it for me. As the first question said, wouldn’t it be more logical to use min-width 100% instead of max-width? Like saying: you have to stay 100% and can’t go less than 100%.
I see that it works this way, but can’t understand why. I’m saying “maximum height is 100%” but maximum 100% means it could also be 90, 80, 70%…

Thanks for the link.
On re-examining my response it actually refers to the width attribute on an img tag. When set to 100% the image always expands to fit its parent container, but scales up and down…
Setting the container width to 100% allows for the similar behavior on a background image, except the image does not scale up and down like it would for the above. max-width allows the image to stretch to fit a large window, and when the window is narrowed to only a few hundred pixels the image still covers the full width width without a horizontal scrollbar coming into play. Remove max- from the property and shrink the width, you will see a scrollbar eventually come in.

The max-width of 100% scales the image to horizontally fit its parent container, preventing the image being cut-off (horizontally) by it.
Previously in the lesson, the images were overflowing the parent container. We solved that with overflow: hidden but that doesn’t stop an image from being too large for its parent container; it just cuts it off at the container.

I feel that responses here somehow created more confusion.
Here is how it works:
In this case u have 3 options.


Go with width: 100% - that will strecth or shrink the image to fill the container, no matter what width container has.


Go with max-width: 100% (like in this case) - this will make the image fill the container UP TO the image maximum size, if the container gets bigger than the image size, the image will not stretch any further. for example, lets say the image size is 640x400. If the container width is 320px the image will adjust to that… but if the container width is larger then 640px, the picture will not stretch any further… it will go UP TO 100% of the image size… that means 640px:


Go with min-width: If we take the example above and we have a picture that is 640x400, min-width: 100% will make the images AT LEAST 640px wide, so if your container is less than that, the image won’t scale down, it will overflow the container.



The only instance scroll bar will appear, is if you use overflow: scroll;

This is what I was looking for when I clicked on this discussion. Makes a lot of sense, thanks!

please notice the sired77 explanation. that’s what we all were looking for. your answers can often be too complicated and off topic.

 sired77:

Im afraid you are wrong. Based on my screenshot the image in your example would just overflow instead.




 mtf:

max-width allows the image to stretch to fit a large window, and when the window is narrowed to only a few hundred pixels the image still covers the full width


then why does it say here, in my screenshot, that an image will overflow when the parent dimensions are exceeded?
Screenshot 2020-01-19 at 00.40.112880×1800 384 KB


There’s nothing wrong with my answer, I was only referring to the width values, the reason the image would overflow in the exercice you mention above, is the height value.

Note that in this case the container has a fixed height of 200px and the image height is set to auto, that means the image height will scale when the width scales to maintain the image aspect ratio and can exceed the 200px height limit of the container. That will result in an overflowed image.


thanks for you kind respond. hope somebody who actually works here will find the time to confirm your words. thank you.

Glad I could help. As a friendly advice, don’t expect a response from a moderator anytime soon… instead get your hands dirty and test it yourself  is not that hard to do it, and it will help you improve a lot more than by simply waiting for someone to confirm if I’m right or wrong.

yes and also sometimes condescending because @mtf sometimes misinterprets a question and gives an answer that confuses the user

A good answer,is all what i need.
(Thank You)

Could you explain this again, but in terms of the logic of what the word min and max represent?
Like a previous @arcsolver39894 said, it makes sense English-wise to use min-width. Why? because if I want the image to always display 100% of its content, then the very smallest % it is allowed would be 100% (min-width).
Using max-width just seems logically wrong to do because again…
If I want to display 100% of its content ALL the time, max would be stupid, because the smallest % it’s allowed is 0%.

47,When should I use px vs rem vs em?,"FAQ,CSS FAQ",q-a,2,"
Question
When should I use px vs rem vs em?

We should use px units when we want to set a specific font-size, height, width, padding, margin, etc that will not change even when the user changes a setting, like a larger default font-size, for the browser.
We should use rem units when we want our text and layout to adjust based on the default font-size a user has set for their browser (which is the default font-size of the html element, usually 16px).
Lastly, we should use em units when we want specific properties of an element to scale proportionately to a font-size other than the default font-size set for the root (html) element.

48,Can an HTML element have multiple classes?,"FAQ,CSS FAQ",,4,"
Question
Can an HTML element have multiple classes?
Answer
Yes! An HTML element can have multiple classes.  To give an element multiple classes we use this syntax: class=""class-one class-two class-three ..."". For example, in the following code we are applying three styles from three different class selectors on the same element:
HTML:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>My Site</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1 class=""greeting hello-world heading"">Hello World</h1>
</body>
</html>

CSS:
.greeting {
  font-family: monospace;
}

.hello-world {
  color: blue;
}

.heading {
  font-size: 34px;
}

","
Why would we want to use multiple classes?

Yes, it definitely can. Sometimes that is very helpful too.
For example, if you have a class that makes text inside of it red (useful for errors, required form inputs, etc.) you will want to be able to use it on elements that sometimes need another tag too.
Example:
<p class=""bold red-text"">Please fill this out!</p>

You probably want this to stand out. You might have a class bold and a class red-text. You want both of these applied, but you don’t want to create another class for bold paragraphs with red text. You simply put in both classes with a space in between.
Remember always to put a space between the names of the classes!

It’s actually very common. People usually have some classes that they think they will use over and over. (e.g. Red text) and they sometimes want to use to different classes on the same element without having to write a whole other class.

50,"What does CSS stand for, and what does it mean?","FAQ,CSS FAQ",q-a,1,"
Question
What does CSS stand for, and what does the full expansion of the abbreviation mean?
Answer
The abbreviation CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.
Cascading refers to how the rules of the style sheet are applied based on order precedence. If there is more than one of the same rule that applies to the same element, the rule that comes later will have greater precedence. In addition, if we link multiple style sheets, the rules from the style sheets that are linked later will have greater precedence than the earlier linked ones.
A Style Sheet is a type of file or language that describes the presentation of a structured document. It is a way to apply “separation of concerns”, by separating the structure (HTML) from the style (CSS). CSS is a particular type of style sheet, mainly used for the Web, to describe the presentation of markup languages such as HTML.

52,Why shouldn't flexbox be used for the layout of an entire page?,"FAQ,CSS FAQ",q-a,2,"
Question
Why shouldn’t flexbox be used for the layout of an entire page?
Answer
Flexbox was not designed to use as a grid system for our websites and web applications - that’s where CSS Grid comes in handy.  That said, many developers use flexbox for their entire page layout (just because they can).
However, we should re-think using flexbox for our entire page layouts as its main purpose is to lay out components of a web page/application in a single horizontal or vertical direction. With flexbox the content determines the layout, for example: if we don’t have enough space in a flex container for our content, we can have our flex items wrap to the next line. We also usually need many nested <div> elements to use as containers if we want our entire layout to use flexbox and this can make our HTML difficult to read (both as a developer reading the HTML or for assistive technology, like a screen reader).

53,Overflow to scroll not working without height,"FAQ,CSS FAQ",q-a,3,"
Question
Why overflow: scroll; works only after setting the height to 1000px, here?
Answer
In order for overflow to work on an element’s content, the element needs to have a definite measurement, otherwise, the element container will keep on expanding to accommodate as many content elements it can have or no matter the content’s size, but if the container element has a set height or a cap height ( max-height), once its content reaches those limits, it will follow the overflow rule, which in case of scroll, it will hide any content that should be surpassing the height of the container, and it will allow us to see it by dragging a scroll bar.
","
What about those content that spill from the width, does scroll cause those spill to warp inside the container?

Are there cases where one would deliberately want to use the overflow property and what cases are those?
Or does it only come when you may have made your container a definite size through oversight, and then subsequently want to avoid the problem of overflow with its content?

No! Although Bootstrap’s grid system is one of its most powerful features, you can use other Bootstrap features including components like dropdown menus, buttons, jumbotrons, etc without using Bootstrap’s grid. That said, be sure to link Bootstrap in your HTML document to use any of its features.
",
55,Why do my flex items looked stretched?,"FAQ,CSS FAQ",q-a,5,"
Question
Why do my flex items looked stretched?
Answer
When we use display: flex; to create a flex container,  align-items: stretch; is declared by default on the flex container. This can make our flex items stretch the entire height or width (depending on flex-direction) of the flex container.
If we do not set a height/width on our flex items, their height/width will be dependent on either the content inside the tallest/widest flex item or the height/width of the flex container, if declared, and the flex items will stretch the entire height/width of the flex container.
There are many ways to solve this issue, two quick solves include:

setting the height/width of the flex items
using a different value than the default, stretch, for the align-items property

","
Why does my container stretch when I use min-height?

@jnijnijni, I recommend you check out this question on Stack Overflow. Hope you understand soon!
Happy coding! 

For the stretch id div, it is asking it to take up the parent height size with the minimum set rule. There was no maximum rule set to it, as long as it does not exceed the size of the parent (container).
I hope I am correct.

do stretch does not matter about value of height given to the flex container ?
and what makes difference in value of min-height  and height in flex container which affects flex items stretch???

I heard that you best avoid inline styling, that working in css is prefferably the way for styling. Is this true and why?

I remember reading in the first HTML sections (or in their discussion boards) it’s called  “separation of concerns” to keep the html, css, and JS separate from each other. Reasons were it’s easier to work on, as opposed to trying to locate everything in one huge document, and also it’s easier to style the page with css since you can style multiple elements at once, as opposed to coding in styling for each element in the html doc.

must you include the ; after every attribute, even if that attribute is the last?
eg. <!p style=“font-family:Arial;”>




 queenni:

…, even if that attribute is the last?


Only the last can be left off since it is followed by a string delimiter. That’s why they call the semi-colon a declaration separator. We only need it if there is another property following.
Most people just go with whatever habit they have formed, but then most people have resolved to avoid inline styles in production code for the maintenance issues they impose. For testing or for isolating they serve a purpose.

CSS is an in dependent language how does it works with html, is it browser magic?




 haroonsateerrahimi:

is it browser magic?


Not magic, no. The browser has three principle APIs: HTML, CSS and ECMAScript. The DOM is constructed from the HTML and the rendering engine merges the CSS rules with their respective selectors. Script runs in the namespace and hooks element nodes by their id, class or tagname.
"
58,Why isn't the margin I set being applied to my elements?,"FAQ,CSS FAQ",q-a,3,"
Question
Why isn’t the margin I set being applied to my elements?
Answer
This could happen for a few reasons including typos in our CSS declarations/document and setting margin-top or margin-bottom on a display: inline; element (as display: inline; elements do not respect margin-top/bottom;).
However, another common reason this may occur is because of collapsing margins. Collapsing margins happen when we have two or more adjacent margins (adjacent top and bottom margins only) on block level elements (display: block;), the adjacent margins combine into a single margin and will compute to the adjacent margin with the highest value.
For example, given the following HTML and CSS, we would expect the margin between .one and .two to be equal to 150px:
HTML:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <meta charset=""utf-8"">
  <meta name=""viewport"" content=""width=device-width"">
  <title>My Site</title>
</head>
<body>
  <div class=""one"">block one</div>
  <div class=""two"">block two</div>
</body>
</html>

CSS:
div {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  border: 1px solid black;
  background: lightpink;
}

.one {
  margin-bottom: 100px;
}

.two {
  margin-top: 50px;
}

But, when we factor in collapsing margins, we’ll remember that the margin that separates the two <div> elements will actually compute to 100px (the highest value of the adjacent margins).

What you are writing is correct. But the back-end code for the exercise always counts everything as incorrect. Even when I copy-paste the solution. It still counts it as incorrect. This problem has happened on several exercises

Yes, and it is not fixed to date. What I do in effect is refresh each time my code ran incorrectly and I am pretty sure I was right, boom, it ran correctly.
Refreshing the page is therefor the solution most of the time.

So is it correct to say that using position: relative allows for moving an element in any direction with the top/bottom/left/right and position: absolute is the same thing except with respect to its parent element?  How are they different?

position: relative positions an element relative to where the element itself would have been if no positioning had been applied.
position: absolute, however, positions the element relative to where the parent element is currently.
I hope that answered your question!

What does the GIF relate to, exactly? I see the black border with its green and blue boxes all moving up out of frame. This doesn’t seem to correspond to either

In the example above, the .box-bottom <div> will be moved down and right from the top left corner of the view. If offset properties weren’t specified, the top box would be entirely covered by the bottom box.
or
The bottom box in this image (colored blue) is displaced from the top left corner of its container. It is 20 pixels lower and 50 pixels to the right of the top box.

I assume the blue box should be moving down-right from the dotted outline. Or that the blue box should be stationary and the black border with green box should move up out of frame behind it? I’m very unsure.

How does the absolute value, effect sibling elements?



The scrolling gif, as already stateted by somebody else, does not seem relevant for this exercise.
It is mentioned, that scrolling and how it affects the different position property values, will be adressed in the next exercise. So it make no sense to have the gif scrolling here and is taking focus from the actual lesson taught here, as it is hard to tell what is actually being depicted on the image hat is scrolling up.


The lesson finishes by stating:


“The bottom box in this image (colored blue) is displaced from the top left corner of its container. It is 20 pixels lower and 50 pixels to the right of the top box.”
But isn’t the last part of that wrong?
It is moved from it’s container, yes, but from the top box?
That would be the case with relative positioning right?
The absolute value positions it in regards to its nearest parent element which would be the container (the big white box).
But this part, “It is 20 pixels lower and 50 pixels to the right of the top box.”
sounds like it is positioned in regards to the green box, which thus far has been refered to as the top box. But the green box is just another  on the same level as the box.buttom  we are currently positioning and thus not it’s parent.
Am I misunderstanding this?



The area denoted by dotted border is where the div should be positioned in normal flow. It is also where the next div in normal flow will be positioned. We’ve taken box-bottom out of normal flow.
All the divs have the same parent, the section. The top div is not a parent.

What do you mean here by where the parent element is currently? Do you mean that the element itself doesn’t move if the parent element moves?
Is this something to do with sibling elements that precede the  element itself? Like absolute is about positioning the element within the parent element bounding box irrespective of what comes before or after it within the box, whereas relative just applies an offset from where the element itself would have been ie after all the proceeding elements in normal html flow?

By “currently” I meant where the element is rather than where it would have been. Sorry if that wasn’t clear.
Yeah, your summary pretty much hits it. Absolute is relative to the parent element regardless of the other elements while relatives is pretty much just an offset.

Thanks for the clarification.
Box model seems a bit counter-intuitive. I gather it’s known for being so. On the other hand, I think the codeacademy lessons could be a lot clearer.
I’m actually going through it for the second time because having done the basic design course once, I tried to build my own website, only to discover I couldn’t make CSS do what I wanted because I’d misunderstood about half of the content of the course.

Why background-color in header covers ul’s margin when position is absolute or fixed?

Hi there !
I’ve a problem understanding the relation between the box in absolute position, and the position of his closest parent’s element.
I’ve tried to do some tests by myself. Without putting any parent’s element, the box move just exactly as you said it should.
Then, I tried to add a parent’s element (a <header> section, then a <main> section with the box inside, in a <div>), but I actually can’t see any difference and I probably misunderstood something in this part… I was thinking that the box will not move set his place from the window, but from the starting of his parent’s element, the <main>, but apparently I’m wrong.
Or maybe a <main> is not really a parent’s element, as it’s just a semantic <div> ? What can I use to set a parent to my <div> ?
Cheers,

All sectioning elements are block level with no default margins or padding, no height, but a width of 100% of its containing parent. The body is the full width of the window, and any direct child block elements will take that width.
The semantic elements mentioned are essentially DIVs with a given name rather than having to give them an id or class. It makes then easy to hook in the style sheet, where the differentiation actually takes place.

“When you changed the position to absolute, you may have noticed that the header shrunk horizontally”, why does the header shrink to fit its content when it is set to position “absolute” or “fixed” ?

I set the position of the header to ‘absolute’, but it doesn’t scroll with the rest of the document. Am I misunderstanding “scroll with the rest of the document”, or am I not writing the code correctly?
header {
background-color: #466995;
border-bottom: 1px solid #466995;
position: absolute;
width: 100%;
}

Oh, figured it out. I was misunderstanding, it is supposed to disappear as you scroll.

Question
In the example given in this exercise, why would we want to use the .brand selector rather than the p selector to target our paragraph?
Answer
The code snippet used in this exercise is purely for demonstrative purpose. However, you can imagine a project where we had multiple <p> elements. Say we only wanted to target a fraction of those elements for styling. We could apply a class attribute specifically to the <p> tags containing the text we wanted to style. In this case, we target the <p> elements we want to style while ignoring those <p> elements we do not want to style.
More generally, this example illustrates how we can use classes to more narrowly target groups of elements.
","
Do variables on computers work like this?, we could  have a class and appy changes not only to the class but also to other elements that are out of that class, such as parts and sections of a program or an app?
I’m sorry if this is a too confused question

What do you mean by computer variables?

Thanks for the insight!

Someone please explain to me why this style for  not active when I add a CSS selector:
In HTML file
Top Vacation Spots
In file style.CSS, I code that:
h1 {
  color: maroon;
}
.title {
  color: teal;
  font-size: 40 px;
}
why the text ""Top Vacation Spots"" isn't maroon in colour and it changes to color teal ??? Maybe there is an order between tag  and class attribute when we style it in CSS?

the use of the “.title” selector overwrites the “h1” selector.

CSS reads code like we read books, left to right, top to bottom. Lets say you read this sentence
Rodger’s hair is blue.
Then you read this one
Actually, it’s green.
Roger’s hair is now green rather than blue, even though blue came first. I hope this makes sense, I’m not anything close to an expert on CSS or any code for that matter, but thats one way of understanding it.

Your example make me feel more easier to understand my problem. Thank you so much

While you are correct on how CSS reads it’s content, this is not the reason for the behavior @changpham  is experiencing. If you define the .title (class) selector above the h1 (element) selector, your page will still render the .title definition rather than the h1 definition. This is because in CSS, class selectors have a higher precedence than element selectors, so your class will always override your element no matter where it’s defined in the stylesheet. However, if you had multiple .title selector definitions, your page would render the final definition of it as you had stated.
CSS selector hierarchy: #ID > .Class > Element

Sorry for the silly question, but what’s #ID for? Inline element or?? Thanks in advance!

Hello @simcam ,
ID is an HTML attribute used to uniquely identify an element. Let’s say you want to add a style for 1 particular button, but do not want to make this change to other your buttons. You would NOT target a class because that would make the change to every element using that class. You also wouldn’t target the button element because that would implement this change for all button. Instead, you target the button by it’s ID because it’s unique and will only make a change to that one button. Hope this makes sense!
Sincerely,
Andrew

Is it that the “class” attribute in css analogous to “id” attribute in html?

One instead of all. 

I believe it’s because in the html file, h1 indicates class=“title”

Are u studying programming language like java? Those classes are different.

Somewhat yes, classes in this case help identify the tags for the style.css just like how an id is used to identify an attribute in html. Hope this helped!

Is there an especial reason why we’re using class rather id in this example? what’s the difference between them? Thanks

The id attribute is used to add a unique identifier to an HTML element. It can then be used to style a specific element in CSS by using the id selector: #id . It can also be used to add functionality to a specific element using JavaScript. One thing to keep in mind is that the id attribute must be unique meaning only one element in an HTML document can have a particular id
The class attribute is also used to add an identifier to an HTML element. However, it doesn’t have to be unique. Multiple elements in the same HTML document can have the same class attribute. This is useful when wanting to style a bunch of elements in the same way

When do I use row[‘hourly_wage’] to access a cell’s data vs row.hourly_wage?

I have the same question. I am also curious as to why we need to include “axis = 1” when that was not necessary in the previous exercise when we created a new column with:
df[‘last name’] = df.name.apply(lamba x:x.split (’’)[-1])

I believe the axis is default to 0 columns hence it does not require an axis be specified

import codecademylib
import pandas as pd
Is there a way to alias the Bolded parts of code below? thanks in advance!
df = pd.read_csv(‘employees.csv’)
#print(df)
total_earned = lambda row: **row[‘hours_worked’]***row[‘hourly_wage’] if row[‘hours_worked’] <= 40 else row[‘hourly_wage’]*40 +(row[‘hours_worked’]-40)*row[‘hourly_wage’]*1.5
df[‘total_earned’] = df.apply(total_earned, axis=1)
print(df)

What are the backslashes in the solution?
When you show the solution, you should be able to go back and look at the code you attempted. View Solution deletes your code and you can’t see what you did wrong. Also, View Solution should only do one step at a time.

I get an invalid syntax error every single time I try to enter my code for the total_error lambda function, even when I just copy the solution. What is going on? It says you don’t need the backslashes but they seem required. This has happened on the last 3 exercises for this lesson.
This is my code so far:
total_earned = lambda row: (row.hourly_wage * 40) + ((row.hourly_wage * 1.5) * (row.hours_worked - 40))
if row.hours_worked > 40
else row.hourly_wage * row.hours_worked

I was wondering the same thing about the backslashes.  They do not appear in any of the examples in the lessons and they don’t make sense to me.

The backslash is an “escape” character. I think that they wanted to put a newline in the code, probably for readability, but they didn’t want the newline to affect the code itself, so they used the backslash to “escape” the effect of the newline.
I found this in Stack Overflow regarding the backslash:
“A backslash at the end of a line tells Python to extend the current  logical  line over across to the next  physical  line.”
Source: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38125328/what-does-a-backslash-by-itself-mean-in-python

My question is: can someone please expand on the use of the ‘row’ syntax (row.column_name / row[‘column_name’]).
Is ‘row’ a function / keyword? What does it mean? Why can we use it to access specific values, when previously we had to use ‘iloc’ or ‘loc’?




 tlspurlin:

total_earned = lambda row: (row.hourly_wage * 40) + ((row.hourly_wage * 1.5) * (row.hours_worked - 40))
if row.hours_worked > 40
else row.hourly_wage * row.hours_worked


I think it is because you have whitespace / newlines before “if” and before “else” in your code which is interrupting the logic. I tried your code that you pasted and it gave me a syntax error. I deleted the whitespace/newlines and it worked.

df[‘new_column’] = df.apply(some function, axis=1) says that you apply function to a row as a whole.
It’s not necessary to write “row” here: function lambda row: row[‘price’]+10 is the same as lambda x: x[‘price’]+10 or whatever else name of parameter: row/x will be changed by each row of a database as an argument.
But I found an interesting moment: row[‘column’] and row.column is not the same if column is string type: the second is fine for numbers but doesn’t work with strings correctly:

Besides we can apply a function not only to a row as a whole but and to a column as a whole if we write axis=0:

apply2506×514 27.7 KB


I had the same issue
The problem is the indentation. It’s necessary the space before the if and else.
total_earned = lambda row: 
(row.hourly_wage * 40) + ((row.hourly_wage * 1.5) * (row.hours_worked - 40)) \
	if row.hours_worked > 40 \
  else row.hourly_wage * row.hours_worked
  
df['total_earned'] = df.apply(total_earned, axis = 1)

print(df)```

I think not everyone works 40h either. So we can’t hard code the *40 in (row.hourly_wage * 40) + ((row.hourly_wage * 1.5) * (row.hours_worked - 40))

It would be helpful to get an answer to this question.
It seems I cannot just transform the given solution [spoiler]
total_earned = lambda row: (row.hourly_wage * 40) + ((row.hourly_wage * 1.5) * (row.hours_worked - 40)) 
if row.hours_worked > 40 
else row.hourly_wage * row.hours_worked
Into
total_earned = lambda row: (row[‘hourly_wage’] * 40) + ((row[‘hourly_wage’] * 1.5) * (row[‘hours_worked’] - 40)) 
if row[‘hours_worked’] > 40 
else row[‘hourly_wage’] * row[‘hours_worked’]
Why? Is it because the axis=1 is missing? If I add it, it doesn’t work either…

Now I see that the reason of this error is not a data type but a column’s name “name” - it seems that Pandas takes name in row.name as a column of indexes:


It seems that a few other people had trouble with the multi-line lambda in this exercise. I’ve found two solutions:
Either use backslash: “” After every line like so:
Capture2965×285 24.9 KB
Or put the lines within parenthesis like so:
Capture963×242 24.8 KB

What is the purpose of the \ ?
I don’t recall seeing it in any lesson relating to lambda or if/else before this. Every lambda or if/else up until now has not required it, but in this lesson it is. Is it because we’re using Pandas? Is it a Pandas or table exclusive requirement?

The purpose of backslashes is joining lines. See this Python reference about explicit and implicit line joining (2.1.5 and 2.1.6) if you like.
For example, if we remove all backslashes from the first code in the post of  @sionchen, we will get a SyntaxError. To avoid this, we need to do some line joining, or make everything into one line without any line breaks.

It’s because the way Python works, you can’t just line break anywhere within a line of code for it to work. When the line of code is too long and you want to continue on a new line for better readability, you use \
So as far as I know, it doesn’t matter whether you’re using lambda, pandas, whatever. You can use \ if you want to write one statement with multiple lines.

62,In the example shown in this exercise wouldn’t it be easier to just apply the `color` and `font-weight` properties to the `h2` selector rather than applying two separate classes to the opening <h1> tag?,"FAQ,CSS FAQ",,8,"
Question
In the example shown in this exercise wouldn’t it be easier to just apply the color and font-weight properties to the h2 selector rather than applying two separate classes to the opening  tag?
Answer
The code snippet in this exercise is used purely for demonstrative purpose. That having been said, you are correct in that it sometimes does makes more sense to use a tag selector to target a whole group of elements as opposed to applying multiple classes to the elements we want to target.
There are numerous CSS organizational philosophies, but it is important to realize that if you were to use an h1 tag selector, your styles would get applied to all the <h1> elements in the HTML document. If you wanted certain <h1> elements to have different styling, you would need to overwrite any declarations you wanted to change within the h1 selector. This can be done by using a higher specificity selector. For example,  given the <h1 class=”bold> … </h1> element, this selector
	font-weight: bold;
	}```

	Would overwrite this selector:
	
	```h1 {
		font-weight: normal.
}```

In this example, our `<h1>` elements with a class of `.bold` would get the bold font-weight styling. 

You will learn more about CSS specificity in exercise 11 so stay tuned!

Must CSS selectors for classes (class selectors?) be only one word long? If they can be more than one word long, how would we distinguish them when typing the class names within the HTML opening tag? Thank you.

I think  you could use an underscore or a hyphen to connect the words together. A space would separate it into two classes.

By applying style properties to class rather than the h1 selector, it would be possible to use the class to style  any other element within the html page, and certain h1 elements?

That’s absolutley correct!

Can you please provide an example of what you mean? Thank you.

Where does h2 comes in picture? I thought we were styling h1 element with different classes. The above question with h2 has confused me.

They may have made a typing mistake, but even if not, the question and responses apply to styling both elements and others.

63,Margin in the box model,"FAQ,CSS FAQ",,10,"
Question
Why is margin part of the box model if it is outside of the box?
Answer
It is mainly part of it for two reasons, the first one is the easiest to take in:
the world wide web consortium (W3C), which is an international community in charge to develop and set the standards  for best web programming practices, have decided that the most efficient way to manipulate elements is using the box model as we know it, where  --and this is the second reason – margin is  a property set on the element and it directly affects it in relation to what surrounds it.
","
I am a newbie to the whole topic, so I probably got this wrong, but could you also say that “margins” are part of the box model because they define the space between the various boxes and so define the way we can position boxes on the page? That is, they tell the browser if another box can go to the left (right, the top or bottom) of the box for which margin is defined and what shape these boxes need to be to fit there.
Or did I get that wrong?
(And sorry for the verbosity: looks like I definitely need to work on that, considering I am learning to code and program to better my chances of becoming a technical writer…;))

Consider the difference between these two terms:
box model
content box

The original spec did not include any of the additional working tools that came with CSS3 so the box model was very literal.
margin -> border -> padding -> content

The content box included everything but margin for the purpose of calculating vertical and horizontal size. Things are different these days now that we have box-sizing.

Thanks for the history lesson: it clarified matters further and showed that I grasped the right concept. Still, I made a mess of phrasing it, which illustrates  my newbie uncertaintly.

This brought me back to biology class, when we studied cell structures. If one can recall the relation between the cell membrane and the cell wall - then the same applies here where the wall interacts with the ‘outside’ (of the cel) defining the ultimate shape; while the membrane is ‘inside’, also providing definition to the elements within it.

Hello! I think this answer https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/sel_hover.aspwill help you!

What is the Box-sizing though ?

From what I understand it, the margin is what the browser interprets as the area of the box itself. While users may not be able to see it, the web browsers think that the margin is the real area of the box. Does that help?

semi-transparent element that we can place over elements (often images) for artistic flair


Can you elaborate on this with an example?

Consider an element that is absolutely positioned to be directly above another element.
If that element is a DIV with a white background and 50% alpha-transparency, we can see through it.
I call this onion skin but it may go by other names. The alpha channel is the key. That is where the masking takes place.

Thank you Roy:smile:

can’t we change the opacity of the text/background alone?

Opacity of text can be changed using opacity for specific selector (maybe). I have tried changing opacity of the texts in p selector using -

p {
font-weight: bold;
font-size: 18px;
font-family: Helvetica;
color: AliceBlue;
line-height: 1.3em;
text-align: left;
width: 100%;
opacity: 0.5;
}

It resulted in fading the color of the text. so yes it worked.
But when i changed the background opacity in body, all the other elements including text, image also had changed it’s opacity.
I found this article helpful, in changing background opacity without having impacts on text.

Opacity is an alpha layer that we can invoke. We need to be clear on the inheritance aspect when getting selective.

How can I change the opacity of the background while keeping the text fully opaque?

When setting the background, use an rgb color value that includes the alpha layer.
Eg.
background-color: rgba(128, 192, 255, 0.4);


https://repl.it/@mtf/input-and-script-access

Ignore the general intent of that page but play with the alpha value in the selector rule. Enter a name so the text appears.

So is it correct to say that using position: relative allows for moving an element in any direction with the top/bottom/left/right and position: absolute is the same thing except with respect to its parent element?  How are they different?

position: relative positions an element relative to where the element itself would have been if no positioning had been applied.
position: absolute, however, positions the element relative to where the parent element is currently.
I hope that answered your question!

What does the GIF relate to, exactly? I see the black border with its green and blue boxes all moving up out of frame. This doesn’t seem to correspond to either

In the example above, the .box-bottom <div> will be moved down and right from the top left corner of the view. If offset properties weren’t specified, the top box would be entirely covered by the bottom box.
or
The bottom box in this image (colored blue) is displaced from the top left corner of its container. It is 20 pixels lower and 50 pixels to the right of the top box.

I assume the blue box should be moving down-right from the dotted outline. Or that the blue box should be stationary and the black border with green box should move up out of frame behind it? I’m very unsure.

How does the absolute value, effect sibling elements?



The scrolling gif, as already stateted by somebody else, does not seem relevant for this exercise.
It is mentioned, that scrolling and how it affects the different position property values, will be adressed in the next exercise. So it make no sense to have the gif scrolling here and is taking focus from the actual lesson taught here, as it is hard to tell what is actually being depicted on the image hat is scrolling up.


The lesson finishes by stating:


“The bottom box in this image (colored blue) is displaced from the top left corner of its container. It is 20 pixels lower and 50 pixels to the right of the top box.”
But isn’t the last part of that wrong?
It is moved from it’s container, yes, but from the top box?
That would be the case with relative positioning right?
The absolute value positions it in regards to its nearest parent element which would be the container (the big white box).
But this part, “It is 20 pixels lower and 50 pixels to the right of the top box.”
sounds like it is positioned in regards to the green box, which thus far has been refered to as the top box. But the green box is just another  on the same level as the box.buttom  we are currently positioning and thus not it’s parent.
Am I misunderstanding this?



The area denoted by dotted border is where the div should be positioned in normal flow. It is also where the next div in normal flow will be positioned. We’ve taken box-bottom out of normal flow.
All the divs have the same parent, the section. The top div is not a parent.

What do you mean here by where the parent element is currently? Do you mean that the element itself doesn’t move if the parent element moves?
Is this something to do with sibling elements that precede the  element itself? Like absolute is about positioning the element within the parent element bounding box irrespective of what comes before or after it within the box, whereas relative just applies an offset from where the element itself would have been ie after all the proceeding elements in normal html flow?

By “currently” I meant where the element is rather than where it would have been. Sorry if that wasn’t clear.
Yeah, your summary pretty much hits it. Absolute is relative to the parent element regardless of the other elements while relatives is pretty much just an offset.

Thanks for the clarification.
Box model seems a bit counter-intuitive. I gather it’s known for being so. On the other hand, I think the codeacademy lessons could be a lot clearer.
I’m actually going through it for the second time because having done the basic design course once, I tried to build my own website, only to discover I couldn’t make CSS do what I wanted because I’d misunderstood about half of the content of the course.

I’ve a problem understanding the relation between the box in absolute position, and the position of his closest parent’s element.
I’ve tried to do some tests by myself. Without putting any parent’s element, the box move just exactly as you said it should.
Then, I tried to add a parent’s element (a <header> section, then a <main> section with the box inside, in a <div>), but I actually can’t see any difference and I probably misunderstood something in this part… I was thinking that the box will not move set his place from the window, but from the starting of his parent’s element, the <main>, but apparently I’m wrong.
Or maybe a <main> is not really a parent’s element, as it’s just a semantic <div> ? What can I use to set a parent to my <div> ?
Cheers,

All sectioning elements are block level with no default margins or padding, no height, but a width of 100% of its containing parent. The body is the full width of the window, and any direct child block elements will take that width.
The semantic elements mentioned are essentially DIVs with a given name rather than having to give them an id or class. It makes then easy to hook in the style sheet, where the differentiation actually takes place.

“When you changed the position to absolute, you may have noticed that the header shrunk horizontally”, why does the header shrink to fit its content when it is set to position “absolute” or “fixed” ?

I set the position of the header to ‘absolute’, but it doesn’t scroll with the rest of the document. Am I misunderstanding “scroll with the rest of the document”, or am I not writing the code correctly?
header {
background-color: #466995;
border-bottom: 1px solid #466995;
position: absolute;
width: 100%;
}

Oh, figured it out. I was misunderstanding, it is supposed to disappear as you scroll.

@cassi2394 Thank you! 

Lol, oh wow. Now y’all are trying to not make sense. Literally, a moving gif? Is the lesson about animation?

No. It is about position.

“When you changed the position to absolute, you may have noticed that the header shrunk horizontally”, why does the header shrink to fit its content when it is set to position “absolute” or “fixed” ?

so in what cases, we have to use px and when em? thanks

The example used in this task has left me quite confused. It states that the font-size of 1.5em is equal to 27 pixels, but surely it should be 24 pixels (16 * 1.5)?
Is there any details I am missing?
Thanks
KJ

16 pixels is the default font size, but here font size is defined as 18 pixels. So the font size of h1 elements will be 18*1.5=27

Whoops, I missed the default 18px font size size.
Thank you!

Hi question about em and rem units. If we are hard-coding the base font size and root element font size in px, wouldn’t the value of the em and rem units always be the same regardless of browser size because the values the relative too are hard coded? Wouldn’t this defeat the purpose of responsive design?

Hello!  I’m working on the Bana’s Travel Blog exercise and for question #1, it asks us to set the font size to 1.5 em in #banner h1.  Here is my code:
#banner h1 {
font-family: ‘Roboto’, sans-serif;
font-weight: 300;
font-size: 1.5em;
color: white;

LearnResponsiveDesign,#11920×1080 501 KB
    }
The font size increases, but I still receive an error message: Did you sent the font size to 1.5em?
It seems to me that this is what I’ve done.  I include a screenshot.
Thanks for any helpful commentary!

68,Why isn't the margin I set being applied to my elements?,"FAQ,CSS FAQ",q-a,3,"
Question
Why isn’t the margin I set being applied to my elements?
Answer
This could happen for a few reasons including typos in our CSS declarations/document and setting margin-top or margin-bottom on a display: inline; element (as display: inline; elements do not respect margin-top/bottom;).
However, another common reason this may occur is because of collapsing margins. Collapsing margins happen when we have two or more adjacent margins (adjacent top and bottom margins only) on block level elements (display: block;), the adjacent margins combine into a single margin and will compute to the adjacent margin with the highest value.
For example, given the following HTML and CSS, we would expect the margin between .one and .two to be equal to 150px:
HTML:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <meta charset=""utf-8"">
  <meta name=""viewport"" content=""width=device-width"">
  <title>My Site</title>
</head>
<body>
  <div class=""one"">block one</div>
  <div class=""two"">block two</div>
</body>
</html>

CSS:
div {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  border: 1px solid black;
  background: lightpink;
}

.one {
  margin-bottom: 100px;
}

.two {
  margin-top: 50px;
}

But, when we factor in collapsing margins, we’ll remember that the margin that separates the two <div> elements will actually compute to 100px (the highest value of the adjacent margins).
","
What you are writing is correct. But the back-end code for the exercise always counts everything as incorrect. Even when I copy-paste the solution. It still counts it as incorrect. This problem has happened on several exercises

Yes, and it is not fixed to date. What I do in effect is refresh each time my code ran incorrectly and I am pretty sure I was right, boom, it ran correctly.
Refreshing the page is therefor the solution most of the time.
Thanks.

70,What is specificity?,"FAQ,CSS FAQ",,5,"
Question
What is specificity?
Answer
When we have two or more conflicting CSS declarations on the same element, the browser gives the declarations a score (the specificity) to determine which declaration will be applied to the element. The declaration with the higher score will be applied to the element.
","
What will happen if two classes declare the same property but with different values on an element? Wich one has the higher specificity?

Hello @dodilei! Welcome to the forum.
I answered a similar question a while back: Is it possible for two selectors targeting the same element to have the same specificity? If so, which styles “win” out?
Get HelpCSS




Is it possible for two selectors targeting the same element to have the same specificity? If so, which styles “win” out? CSS


    Yes. It still will receive the style specified by the last selector in order from top to bottom that refers to the html element specified. The order in which the class names appear in the element tag itself will make no difference. They still refer to the same element which receives the style. The classes aren’t styled, they just identify the element.
  

If that doesn’t answer your question, please post again. Happy coding!

can i change size of footer in “p” property also? it is proper step to do ?

71,What positioning values should I be familiar with?,"FAQ,CSS FAQ",q-a,2,"
Question
What positioning values should I be familiar with?
Answer
Web developers should be familiar with:
position: static;

default position
positioned according to normal flow of HTML document
offset properties (top, right, bottom, left) and z-index property have no effect

position: relative;

positioned according to normal flow of the document (not taken out of the normal flow)
will be affected by offset properties (top, right, bottom, left) and z-index

if offset properties are used, the element will be offset in relation to its default position

position: absolute;

element is taken out of the normal flow of the document
positioned in relation to its nearest positioned parent element (grandparent, etc),
if no positioned parent element exists, the absolutely positioned element will be positioned in relation to the <html> element
will be affected by offset properties (top, right, bottom, left) and z-index


and
position: fixed;

element is taken out of the normal flow of the document
positioned in relation to the viewport of the browser
will be affected by offset properties (top, right, bottom, left) and z-index

Thank, its a grat contribution for new devs like me for example.

72,Can I make my Bootstrap columns stack at screen widths other than widths less than 768px (tablet width)?,"FAQ,CSS FAQ",q-a,3,"
Question
Can I make my Bootstrap columns stack at screen widths other than widths less than 768px (tablet width)?
Answer
We can make our columns stack at different screen widths using the Bootstrap classes col-xs-..., col-sm-..., col-md-..., and col-lg-....


col-xs-... will keep columns horizontal and will not stack no matter how small the screen width.

col-sm-... will stack columns when the screen width is less than or equal to 768px.

col-md-... will stack columns when the screen width is less than or equal to 992px.

col-lg-... will stack columns when the screen width is less than or equal to 1200px.

","
What do you mean by ‘stack’ columns ?

They are not shown horizontally anymore but more like one on the top of the another. Then it depends on what class you use, how stacked the elements will be.
Excuse my English I hope you understand 
"
73,What is a CSS selector?,"FAQ,CSS FAQ",,5,"
Question
What is a CSS selector?
Answer
CSS selectors are used to target HTML elements for styling. There are many different types of selectors, several of which were covered in the last lesson. If you have been going through this course sequentially, the selectors you have learned about thus far are:

id selectors
class selectors
descendant selectors
chained or qualified selectors

","
2 posts were split to a new topic: Sn’t the first one we learned “tag name selector”?

Hello fellow community i do have inquiries in regards to the selectors.
Are all these 4 selectors important and should i always use them when styling my HTML, am having a hard time figuring out this

The 4 selectors so far are in indeed important ,but there is no “always” when styling your code.
Look at it this way.
you have a <p> tag with the class = ""firstparagraph"" , Now you can actually style your paragraph
using :
p { }
But whatever you put inside those curly braces {} would affect all your  elements.
Now what if you just want to style that specific paragraph? That’s when a class selector comes in ( you can use the firstparagraph class to style that one paragraph and anything else with the same class).
This is just one of the many examples that I could use. That said, while some of the selectors might not be necessary for you, They in fact help and make your work alot better and easier.

The most important selector of all has been omitted from the list in the opening post… type selector from which we also derive the pseudo element selector.
If we remove the first two items from the list given in the OP we could not utilize the other two: No. 3 without an element (type) selector, and in No. 4 type selectors cannot be chained.
Tracing back in history to the 1980s we might find that element and selector are actually synonymous terms. An element is a selector and vice-versa in this respect.
<p> => tag => element => type => selector

We can traverse the entire document without using id or class just by knowing a type.
p {/*
    property: value;
*/}

We refer to this as a generic type selector rule.
It’s ‘generic’ because it is pervasive and the rule applies globally; ‘type’ because it refers to a native HTML element; and, ‘selector rule’ because it is selectively declarative.

The number 3 item in the list is one of a group of combinators, very useful selector specifiers.

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Selectors/Combinators

We see from the above that these don’t come up at the beginning so will stop here.

74,When should I use named colors vs hexadecimal colors vs rgb colors?,"FAQ,CSS FAQ",q-a,3,"
Question
When should I use named colors vs hexadecimal colors vs rgb colors?
Answer
This decision is mostly based on personal preference.  A few tips to help you decide:


Named colors (example: cornflowerblue, orangered, gold, etc) only have 140 colors to choose from, although the names may be easier to remember than strings of numbers or characters.

Hexadecimal and rgb colors make it easier to get the specific/exact color you want (as they have ~16.7 million color choices).

Hexadecimal colors are more compact than rgb colors and may be easier to copy from various color palette programs i.e. copying one number vs three numbers.

","
How are hexidecimal colors formed? If i want to make blue for example, how do i know what numbers and letters to write after the #?

use a color picker, there are plenty of sites, here is a random one:

sometimes a colorpicker is even included in the editor or there is a plugin.

75,Why is the box model concept important?,"FAQ,CSS FAQ",,3,"
Question
Why is the box model concept important?
Answer
The box model concept is important because the browser renders each and every element as a  rectangle, or box. Each box has a content area - the height and width of the “real” content (like text, images, and videos), padding - the space between the content edge and the border, border - outline that wraps the padding plus the content, and margin - space between the border and the nearest element.
","
to put it in more of a perspective for me, if you’d be so kind.  If the box model were a picture, frame included-----what would be what?  Thank You. i get that the picture would be the content.

I would look at it as the content as the picture, the padding as the mat around the picture, the border as the actual frame and then the margin as the space between this object and the next picture on the wall. Someone please correct me if that is not quite right.

76,Why are there no units on the flex-grow value?,"FAQ,CSS FAQ",q-a,1,"
Question
Why are there no units on the flex-grow value?
Answer
On a flex item, flex-grow takes values that are positive integers to specify a proportion of space to take up in comparison to the other flex items if extra space is available within the flex container. There are no units because the value is a proportion.

77,"In the last lesson we learned about the various ways of loading CSS into an HTML document. In this exercise, why didn’t we use inline styles or the `<style>` tags to load the CSS?","FAQ,CSS FAQ",,7,"
Question
In the last lesson we learned about the various ways of loading CSS into an HTML document. In this exercise, why didn’t we use inline styles or the <style> tags to load the CSS?
Answer
As developers we want to “separate our concerns” because this usually creates codebases that are more flexible, readable, and maintainable. As such, keeping our CSS contained within a separate .css file is the preferred way of including CSS within most projects.
For a deeper dive into some of the nuances here, take a look at this article.

There is no article linked though. Could you add it? thanks

Article link please?

It is best practice to keep HTML and CSS separate.

Question
What is the purpose of Bootstrap’s btn btn-primary class?
Answer
The btn btn-primary class is one of the styles of buttons provided by Bootstrap and gives more semantic meaning to the element (for yourself and for anyone reading your code).  For example, the btn btn-primary class is normally used to denote that the element it’s on (<a>, <input>, or <button>) will perform the primary action of a form.  Other useful Bootstrap button classes include btn btn-default, btn btn-success, btn btn-info, btn btn-warning, and btn btn-danger.

81,Can I give each side of my content different padding?,"FAQ,CSS FAQ",q-a,1,"
Question

padding-top: 10px; /*will set padding-top to 10px*/
padding-right: 2rem; /*will set padding-right to 2rem*/
padding-bottom: 1em; /*will set padding-bottom to 1em*/
padding-left: 5px; /*will set padding-left to 5px*/

Question
This exercise talks about the style attribute. What is an attribute?
Answer
Within this context, an attribute is a means of extending an HTML element so that developers can modify the behavior or provide metadata about that element. Attributes are always included within the opening tag of an HTML element like so:
<h1 style=”font-size: 18px;”>
The style attribute allows us to define CSS rules on an element but there are countless other attributes an HTML element can have. For some context here, check out Mozilla docs for a complete list of HTML attributes.

85,When should I use id selectors vs class selectors?,"FAQ,CSS FAQ",q-a,1,"
Question
When should I use id selectors vs class selectors?
Answer
We should use class selectors to style multiple elements at the same time with the same styles. Note that elements can have multiple classes applied to them.
However, an element can only have one id and that id value has to be unique to the entire HTML document.  We use id selectors to apply styles to a single, specific, element in our HTML document.  Also, id selectors have a higher specificity than element or class selectors. This means that we can use an id selector to override styles coming from element or class selectors targeting a specific element. For example, given the following HTML and CSS, we expect the text of our <h1> element to be green:
HTML:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>My Site</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1 class=""greeting"" id=""hello"">Hello World</h1>
</body>
</html>

CSS:
h1 {
  color: red;
}

.greeting {
  color: blue;
}

#hello {
  color: green;
}

Elements can be hidden from view with the visibility property. Why would someone choose to hide an element? If I don’t want it to be shown, shouldn’t I use the block comment /* instead?

Much of what we access on the web today is dynamic in nature, that means immediate change in view occurs with every listened for event. Take for instance a menu that is out of sight until the user hovers on a hamburger icon, then pops into view.
Mind, this would not be a use for visibility but display. The latter takes the object completely out of normal flow, the former does not.
visibility applies to a defined object and does not alter its position in normal flow. If it has dimensions, it will take up space, whether visible or hidden. Where this comes into play is when we have a defined layout and we don’t want it jumping around, but stable, with everything maintaining its position.
Say for instance our code displays messages at various intervals or upon given events and outcomes that we don’t want to display for very long. Popping in a message will cause the lines below that point to shift in order to make room for the message to fit in. visibility protects the real estate that message needs to display. When the message is gone, the space remains, but is unoccupied.
function timeOut(el) {
  setTimeout(() => {
    el.textContent = '';
  }, 2000);
};

The above nulls out a string, but also causes the line it was written on to also drop out. Content below jumps up.
function timeOut(el) {
  el.style.visibility = 'visible';
  setTimeout(() => {
    el.style.visibility = 'hidden';
  }, 2000);
};

will hide the textContent but will not give up the line. Mind, we can still collapse if we so desire. In either case, we do not manipulate the textContent. It gets set elsewhere.

In exercise 4, reference is made to the CSS selector “.site-nav-mobile”, but that class does not exist within the index.html code.
In addition, the editor indicates error on line 113, because the tag “small” was written as “smalL”, and on line 145, where the paragraph tag is given a value of id = ""support-pages "", which already that id value was assigned to another tag in line 131 of the html code.

Is it only the universal selector that the border-box can be applied to?




 tochiama:

border-box


That box-sizing value can be applied to any element to which a border can be applied.  That means all block level elements.
What’s more, it is not very judicious to use the universal selector at all given the amount of resources expended. It selects everything in the HTMLElement group and writes the rule for each node type, regardless whether it exists in the document or not. Better to write selector rules for elements that actually exist. The universal selector is not a silver bullet, but an expensive hotel bill.
* {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

IMHO, this is so not right, but there would not be this selector if there wasn’t a valid use for it. Let your studies reveal it, and learn to use it wisely, or never.

So if the border-box allows borders and padding to leave the box dimensions unaffected, which part of the box gives it this space? Is it the box-content that becomes smaller?

To clarify with an example:
A border box with the dimensions 200px by 300px has a 3px border and a 10px padding. Does the box-content become 26px smaller?




 martijndireks:

Does the box-content become 26px smaller?


Yes. It has to shrink so the box does not change size.

what other values can

box-sizing

have??




 saraf.pratham:

box-sizing



box-sizing


Is it a good practice to always set the Box Model this way or just in especific situations?

How we set the box model is a choice, not a best practice. Only the developer can make that choice. There is no rule, as it were.

Hi Roy,
I just wanted to clarify to make sure I understand what you’re saying.
Are you saying that we should try to avoid using

{} ?

(Actually I’m trying to insert an asterisk there but I don’t know why it keeps turning into a bullet)



 mtf:

Better to write selector rules for elements that actually exist.


Does it mean to say we should simply declare the box sizing whenever we set the rules for any aspect of the box ? e.g.
p {
box sizing: border-box;
padding: 20px;
}
Thanks!!

It’s my way of thinking, yes. The universal selector is a resource hog. Even with vastly improved computer speed and memory, resources are resources. We should endeavor to conserve at every turn.

Ok got it! Thanks so much!

Hey Roy @mtf  and everyone,
I was wondering, in terms of economizing code, in this case adding a border-box, would you agree (recommend, abhor, etc) to use a class=“border-box” for example and apply at my own discretion.
I get that its up to each coder, however it seems like you have seen a lot code, so I was wondering if this would be an acceptable attempt on your opinion. I’m trying to not be too wild at first, cuz I know I want to work with other people as I advance in this.
Thanks a lot!

We see a universal rule often applied to such properties as ‘border-box’, but for my own part I don’t use universal rules, as a rule. Consider which elements the property will apply to and write a selector rule that selects those elements.

The purpose of the exercises for this lesson is never explicit, but I guess we’re instructed to change the background color so that the contact form, colored in white, will pop up and attract the user’s attention. Am I right?

If the title of the lesson is any indication, it is not about, call to action as much as it addresses accessibility for users with visual challenges. Contrast is a very important concern when choosing foreground and background colors.

116,Is there ever a situation where using the `!important` flag is advisable?,"FAQ,CSS FAQ",q-a,1,"
Question
Is there ever a situation where using the !important flag is advisable?
Answer
As this lesson alludes to, we generally want to avoid using the !important flag as it can lead to time consuming specificity wars. However, one scenario where the !important flag might be advisable is in the case of customizing user style sheets. User style sheets control the way a web browser displays every page a user visits.
For instance, a developer might decide to use the !important flag to customize a browser’s user style sheet such that every page she visited displayed text in a larger font size. In this type of scenario, the !important flag might be used to improve the user experience for the visually impaired.

117,Will changing the `padding` and `margin` affect the dimensions of an element’s box?,"FAQ,CSS FAQ",q-a,1,"
Question
Will changing the padding and margin affect the dimensions of an element’s box?
Answer
As you will learn in a future exercise, modifying an element’s padding and margin properties will not affect it’s box dimensions unless we also modify the element’s default box-sizing value.
",
118,Can content ever spill out of the content area and into the padding?,"FAQ,CSS FAQ",q-a,1,"
Question
Can content ever spill out of the content area and into the padding?
Answer
Yes it can! For example, say you have a <p> tag containing lots of text. If you set the height of the content area on this <p> box, the text of this element may very well spill out of it’s content area and into it’s padding.
You will learn how to deal with situations like this later in the lesson.

120,Is the border thickness added to the box height and width?,"FAQ,CSS FAQ",q-a,1,"
Question
Is the border thickness added to the box height and width?
Answer
It is important to realize that there is a distinction between the rendered height and width of an element and the width and height properties of an element. By default, the width and height properties only affect the content area of a box. This means that while the border, padding, and margin properties do affect the rendered dimensions of an element they do not factor into the width and height of a box’s content area as specified by the width and height properties.
As you will learn in the next lesson, this default behavior can be modified with the box-sizing: border-box; declaration.

Question
In the code snippet shared in this exercise the border has a color of rgb(22, 77, 100). I have never seen color represented in this way before. What does it mean?
Answer
This representation allows developers to specify a numeric value for red, green and blue color components. Each color component can be specified with a value between 0-255. This means that this scheme allows us to represent 256 * 256 *256 = 6,777,216 different colors!
You will learn more about the 4 different ways of representing color in CSS in unit 4.

122,How does the padding property “expand the background-color”? Does the background-color property not apply to a box element’s margin and border?,"FAQ,CSS FAQ",q-a,1,"
Question
How does the padding property “expand the background-color”? Does the  background-color property not apply to a box element’s margin and border?
Answer
The background of an element includes an element’s content area, border and padding but not it’s margin. Hence, by increasing the border, the padding, the width, or the height of an element we can expand the area that gets affected by the background-color property.

123,"The padding implementation shown in this exercise is more concise than the implementation shown in the last exercise. However, isn’t it also less readable? Which implementation should I use?","FAQ,CSS FAQ",q-a,1,"
Question
The padding implementation shown in this exercise is more concise than the implementation shown in the last exercise. However, isn’t it also less readable? Which implementation should I use?
Answer
Either implementation is fine to use so long as you are consistent with it. Most style guides recommend using the more concise padding declaration when possible but it is sometimes necessary to use the padding declarations shown in the last exercise.
Once you remember that the more concise padding declaration specifies values moving clockwise starting from the top of a box, the readability of this declaration is not so obscured.
",
124,"It seems like modifying either the padding or the margin property will change the spacing between elements. If I want to create space between elements, how do I know which property to modify?","FAQ,CSS FAQ",q-a,1,"
Question
It seems like modifying either the padding or the margin property will change the spacing between elements. If I want to create space between elements, how do I know which property to modify?
Answer
This is very layout dependent but in general we want to use the margin property to change the spacing between elements and the padding property to create space within the element itself (between the content of an element and it’s border).
",
125,"The margin implementation shown in this exercise is more concise than the implementation shown in the last exercise. However, isn’t it also less readable? Which implementation should I use?","FAQ,CSS FAQ",q-a,1,"
Question
The margin implementation shown in this exercise is more concise than the implementation shown in the last exercise. However, isn’t it also less readable? Which implementation should I use?
Answer
As with the more concise padding declaration, either implementation is fine to use so long as you are consistent with it. Most style guides recommend using the more concise margin declaration when possible but it is sometimes necessary to use the margin declarations shown in the last exercise.
Once you remember that the more concise padding and margin declarations specify values moving clockwise starting from the top of a box, the readability of these more concise declarations are not so obscured.

why do we use .b to set class=“box b” not   .box b

A space in the class attribute means that each word is a seperate class.
Therefore, the element with class box b has both the box class and the b class, not a single class named box b.
Therefore, with .b, it is saying to apply the style to all elements with the b class. If you were to apply to elements matching .box b, it would apply to all bold text (<b> inside elements with the box class.
If you wanted to match an element with both the box and b classes, you would do: .box.b.
I hope that makes sense!


Instruction #3

“Let’s also make box  b  take up a few rows. Use  grid-row  with  span  to make the item take up rows two through four.”


Answer:  grid-row: 2 / span 3;


Why is the “span 3” and not “span 4”?
It confuses me because it ask’s to take up rows two through FOUR.

Because span 3 will make it span 3 rows, so starting with row 2, count: Row2, Row3, Row4.
If we used span 4, it will make it go one farther then we want, to row 5.

If anyone is having a hard time conceptualizing this, I recommend using graph paper and drawing out the same dimensions as the grid in the exercise.

grid-template-columns: 3fr 50% 1fr;
and
grid-template-columns: 3fr 4fr 1fr;
Don’t these lines do the same?

Confused by fr exercise? Does anyone have a simple explanation of how they understood this exercise?

Just going through lessons myself, so corrections are welcome;
Using fr is a way to use fractions to divide the space. The bottom of the fraction is determined by how many units of fr you use overall.
Say you have 1 column:

grid-template-columns: 1fr;

That means that column is 1/1 of the width of the grid.
But now you add a second column:

grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;

Now each column is 1/2 of the width of the grid. Each column is 1fr and there are a total of 2fr, so 1/2.
And this extrapolates out:

grid-template-columns: 1fr 2fr 1fr 5fr;

Now there are four columns, and a total of 10fr. So, in order, each column width is 1/10, 2/10, 1/10, 5/10.
Also, the fractions only account for undefined width. If any of your columns have a defined width, it is ignored from the fraction.

grid-template-columns: 1fr 2fr 1fr 5fr 50%;

We’re still at 10fr total, but the new column is set to 50% of the width, so now the fraction columns are fighting over half of the space they had before.
Say that:

width: 1000px;

Before we introduced the 50% column, the column sizes would have been 100px (1/10), 200px (2/10), 100px (1/10), 500px (5/10).
But with the 50% column introduced and stealing 500px of the total 1000px, the fraction column sizes have changed: 50px (1/10), 100px (2/10), 50px (1/10), 250px (5/10).
Hope that all makes sense and I’m not spouting anything super wrong!

“By using the  fr  unit, we can define the size of columns and rows as a fraction of the grid’s length and width.”
Shouldnt that be height and width? I mean, I get what you mean with length, but wouldn’t it be easier to understand if the actual term of  the correct property was used?

Looks like it to me!
The second declaration divides the container width into 8 fractional pieces, thus 4fr = 50% of available width space.

I’ve read some CSS textbook that says, when using <link> to introduce the CSS file, it’s fine to omit the type attribute since browsers today automatically detect its type.
I’m wondering if that still holds true. If we omit the type attribute, anything undesirable might happen?

HTML5 simplified things a little by establishing de facto MIME types for style sheets and scripts, text/css and text/javascript, respectively. That means under that doctype, we no longer need to declare it in our markup.
As far as undesirable outcomes, they would be rare, and only possible in older, out of date user agents. The odds are very small.
Modern browsers are most likely capable of reading file headers which clearly state the MIME type, regardless of the extension deployed.
If a lesson still expects us to use the type attribute on these resources, then humor the author and use it, otherwise, don’t be afraid to leave it out.

Why is there 2 lines of codes in html linking to css in the head section?

<head>
  <title>Typography Blog</title>
  <link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""styles/reset.css"">
  <link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""styles/style.css"">
</head>

I believe this is what you are referring to. Notice the href values refer to two different style sheets: reset.css and style.css. In the exercise, you are working with style.css. Codecademy is linking reset.css to remove default styles from almost every html element. Many developers do this to avoid default behavior from interfering with expected behavior. If you click on the folder icon in the top left of the code editor, you can navigate to styles/reset.css and have a look at what it does. Hope this helps 

Yes, that was what I was referring to. Thanks.

It seems strange to be mashing two languages together in a single document. Is this common practice?

I just completed the exercise. Indeed, the first paragraph changed to “arial”.
The question is that I put the css code under the head, as the exercise demands, but the “arial” worked only for the first paragraph, not for the following paragraphs. I thought that at the head it would be global for all the paragraphs.




 spiros13:

the “arial” worked only for the first paragraph, not for the following paragraphs.


This is because there is only one Paragraph in the exercise. The other blocks of text are in a Div elements.

if the  element was applied inside of the  element why has the paragraph inside of the  element change?

I’ve learnt that there are three different ways to make use of css styling. The inline, the ? tag and the separate .css file. My question now is, Can you use the three in a single file? Also, in a case where i use different styles for a particular element e.g , which would overwrite the other?  Like if in the inline styling, i set the color of  to red but in the style tag i set it to blue and in the .css file, its set to green… which would actually appear/

I’m just curious what that ""p "" is doing there?
<head>
  <style>
    p {
      color: red;
      font-size: 20px;
    }
  </style>
</head>


Not something that would actually affect the content, but just curious - what is the conventional norm when adding < style > element to the < head > of the html code - should the < title > element come before or after < style >?

I am just a beginner myself, but from what I gather, “p” (or any other tag name) tells the browser to render everything with these tags (the first paragraph in the exercise we just completed) in the style you specify in the curly brackets.

164,Can we use the `overflow` property to hide columns that spill out of our grid?,"FAQ,CSS FAQ",q-a,1,"
Question
Can we use the overflow property to hide columns that spill out of our grid?
Answer
Yes! Declaring overflow: hidden; on a grid container will hide any content that spills out of the grid. Note that it is usually a better idea to create flexible, responsive grids rather than hiding content.

Question

Answer
CSS Grid is where we are headed and it is a good idea to learn this specification. The decision to use this layout method is largely dependent on the project and the browsers that need to be supported. As it stands now, CSS Grid is gaining wider adoption and can be safely be used in projects with proper fallbacks, overrides, and prefixes.

169,Can rows also spill out of the grid like we saw with columns in the last exercise?,"FAQ,CSS FAQ",q-a,1,"
Question
Can rows also spill out of the grid like we saw with columns in the last exercise?
Answer
Yes, rows can also spill out of a grid container. This is one of the reasons we need to be especially careful when dealing with fixed widths and heights.
",
170,"While the `grid-template` property may be more concise than using the properties illustrated in the last two exercises, isn’t this syntax also less readable? Which syntax should I use here?","FAQ,CSS FAQ",q-a,1,"
Question
While the grid-template property may be more concise than using the properties illustrated in the last two exercises, isn’t this syntax also less readable? Which syntax should I use here?
Answer
I also find grid-template-row and grid-template-column properties to be more readable than the grid-template property. If you are working on a project with other people, then it is best to conform to whatever syntax your teammates have used. However, if you are working solo or there is no precedent for you to emulate, then this is really a matter of personal preference.
Whatever syntax you prefer, remember to be consistent with it.

171,Can `fr` units only be used when we have declared `display: grid;` on an element?,"FAQ,CSS FAQ",q-a,1,"
Question
Can fr units only be used when we have declared display: grid; on an element?

Yes. The fr unit is only applies to CSS grid containers.
",
172,Why doesn’t the `minmax()` function work if we have a `width` property is defined on the grid container?,"FAQ,CSS FAQ",q-a,1,"
Question
Why doesn’t the minmax() function work if we have a width property is defined on the grid container?
Answer
We can actually use the minmax() function to define column widths on a fixed width grid. However, if the width (or height) of the grid is fixed then it doesn’t make much sense to define a range that a column (or row) can expand or shrink through because the column (or row) of this grid will also be fixed.
",
173,"In the code snippet shared in this exercise, we didn’t define `grid-template-rows`. How does our content fill in a grid when this property is not specified?","FAQ,CSS FAQ",q-a,1,"
Question
In the code snippet shared in this exercise, we didn’t define grid-template-rows. How does our content fill in a grid when this property is not specified?
Answer
As you will learn in the next lesson, when we don’t explicitly define grid-template-rows, the implicit grid takes over. When this happens, rows get filled up first and new rows are created as necessary. The new rows will only be as tall as the content they contain.
",
174,Do the rows and columns of a CSS grid always have to be explicitly defined?,"FAQ,CSS FAQ",q-a,1,"
Question
Do the rows and columns of a CSS grid always have to be explicitly defined?
Answer
No. As you will learn in the next lesson, when rows or columns are not defined an implicit grid kicks in to control how content gets added to the grid.
",
175,What would it mean for `grid-row-start` or `grid-row-end` to have negative values?,"FAQ,CSS FAQ",q-a,1,"
Question
What would it mean for grid-row-start or grid-row-end to have negative values?
Answer
If a negative integer is used, the grid line count starts in reverse. For example, grid-row-start: -1; specifies the grid line at the far most right of the grid and `grid-column-start: -1;” specifies the grid line at the bottom of the grid.
",
176,Is it correct to say that the `grid-template-row` property determines the `height` of a grid item?,"FAQ,CSS FAQ",q-a,1,"
Question
Is it correct to say that the grid-template-row property determines the height of a grid item?
Answer
Yes, the grid-template-row property determines the height of a grid item. However, this height can be overwritten by applying the height property to the grid item itself.
",
177,Can the `span` keyword only be used with the `grid-row` and `grid-column` properties?,"FAQ,CSS FAQ",q-a,1,"
Question
Can the span keyword only be used with the grid-row and grid-column properties?
Answer
Yes. The span keyword is specific to these two CSS grid properties.
",
178,The `grid-area` property doesn’t seem to be very readable. Is this property used much in practice or do most developers stick with the more readable (but less concise) `grid-row` and `grid-column` properties?,"FAQ,CSS FAQ",q-a,1,"
Question
The grid-area property doesn’t seem to be very readable. Is this property used much in practice or do most developers stick with the more readable (but less concise) grid-row and grid-column properties?
Answer
It is always best to conform to whatever syntax is already being used within a project but if you are working on a solo project then this is a matter of personal preference.
I do find grid-row and grid-column to be more readable than the grid-area property and so I tend to use those properties instead. Whatever syntax you prefer, remember to be consistent with it.
",
179,If we are using external fonts do we need to also include fallback fonts in our stylesheet?,"FAQ,CSS FAQ",q-a,1,"
Question
If we are using external fonts do we need to also include fallback fonts in our stylesheet?
Answer
Yes it is a good idea to use fallbacks just in case our font becomes unavailable. For example, say we are using a Google Font that gets removed from the directory or perhaps the server(s) that is hosting the directory goes down. To hedge our bets against unintended incidents like this, use fallback fonts.
",
180,What are the pros and cons of using CSS grid vs a framework like Bootstrap?,"FAQ,CSS FAQ",q-a,1,"
Question
What are the pros and cons of using CSS grid vs a framework like Bootstrap?
Answer
There a quite a few advantages to using the native CSS Grid over external grid frameworks.  Some of the advantages include:

Reduced code bloat. Rather than creating extra HTML elements to contain your grid, columns, and rows, your grid tracks are created within your stylesheet.
Improved semantics. Frameworks like Bootstrap often compel developers to venture into divitis territory. What’s more, grid frameworks don’t always use the most semantically sound class names.
Reduced file sizes. As CSS Grid is native, there is no need to include large libraries like Bootstrap in your projects.
Speed of development. Once you learn the syntax, prototyping with CSS Grid is fast and efficient.

Right now, one disadvantage to using CSS Grid is that it is not supported by every browser. To see which browsers still do not support this feature, check out Can I use.
",
181,Is there another syntax we can use to overlap elements within CSS grid?,"FAQ,CSS FAQ",q-a,1,"
Question
Is there another syntax we can use to overlap elements within CSS grid?
Answer
Yes there is! grid-area is a shorthand for the grid-row and grid-column properties you learned about in the last lesson. Hence, instead of applying the grid-area: 6 / 4 / span 2 / span 2; declaration to our .overlap class in step 3 of this exercise, we could apply these two declaration: grid-row: 6 /span 2 ;,  grid-column: 4 /span 2; to the class.
",
182,Can we say that the `justify-items` property overwrites the column widths defined by the `grid-template-columns` property?,"FAQ,CSS FAQ",q-a,1,"
Question
Can we say that the justify-items property overwrites the column widths defined by the grid-template-columns property?
Answer
No, justify-items does not affect the widths of our grid columns. However, it does affect the widths of our grid items within our columns. For example, say we apply the following declarations applied to a grid container: grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr; ,  justify-items: center;. In this case, we will have a grid with 4 columns of equal width. Each grid item will only be as wide as it’s content and it will be centered within a grid column. If we remove the justify-items: center; declaration or use the justify-items: stretch; declaration instead, the width of our columns will stay the same. However, the width of each grid item will stretch to match the entire width of each column.
Note, declaring the width property on a grid item will overwrite the widths determined by the justify-items property.
",
183,Is it correct to say that `justify-items` aligns grid items horizontally within columns whereas `justify-content` aligns the columns themselves within the grid?,"FAQ,CSS FAQ",q-a,1,"
Question
Is it correct to say that justify-items aligns grid items horizontally within columns whereas justify-content aligns the columns themselves within the grid?
Answer
Yes! This is the correct understanding of these two properties.
",
184,"The Mozilla docs say that `align-items: stretch;` is the default behavior. If this behavior is default, why do we even need to specify the `stretch` keyword?","FAQ,CSS FAQ",q-a,1,"
Question
The Mozilla docs say that align-items: stretch; is the default behavior. If this behavior is default, why do we even need to specify the stretch keyword? Can’t we just achieve the desired stretch behavior by omitting the align-items: stretch; declaration altogether?
Answer
So long as there are no declarations overwriting the default, yes you can have your grid items span the entire height of a row by simply omitting the align-items: stretch; declaration. However, it is still necessary to have this stretch keyword defined in the spec for several reasons:

All default behavior is coming from a user agent stylesheet. This stylesheet needs to have this default behavior defined in order to apply the styling to our HTML document.

2)We may run into situations where we want to overwrite some other align-items property. For example, say we want to apply this declaration to our grid in desktop view: align-items: center;. However, for our mobile design we want our grid items to span the height of the entire row. In this case, we would have to overwrite our previously defined declaration with align-items: stretch; within the appropriate media query.
",
185,Is it correct to say that `align-items` aligns grid items vertically within rows whereas `align-content` aligns the rows themselves within the grid?,"FAQ,CSS FAQ",q-a,1,"
Question
Is it correct to say that align-items aligns grid items vertically within rows whereas align-content aligns the rows themselves within the grid?
Answer
Yes! This is the correct understanding of these two properties. In order to see the align-content property in action, we must give the grid container a height and ensure that our rows don’t totally fill this height.
For instance, say we had these declaration applied to our grid container: grid-template-rows: repeat(3, 100px) 1fr;, align-content: center; , height: 500px;. In this case, the align-content property doesn’t affect the grid because our rows entirely span the 500px height of the grid. The first 3 rows take up 300px and the last row spans the remaining 200px vertical space.
",
186,Can the `justify-self` and `align-self` properties be used to allow an item to overlap another item or items?,"FAQ,CSS FAQ",q-a,1,"
Question
Can the justify-self and align-self properties be used to allow an item to overlap another item or items?
Answer
No. The justify-self and align-self properties control the position of a grid item within a grid item’s own cell. For example, justify-self will only place a grid item horizontally within the column that contains that grid item. Likewise, align-self will only place a grid item vertically within the row that contains that grid item.
",
187,How does defining the height of a grid influence the `grid-auto-rows` property?,"FAQ,CSS FAQ",q-a,1,"
Question
How does defining the height of a grid influence the grid-auto-rows property?
Answer
Defining the height of a grid should not influence the grid-auto-rows property. For example, if we apply this declaration to our grid container grid-auto-rows: 100px;  any implicitly added rows will have a height of 100px regardless of the actual grid height. In practice, this means that our grid might be smaller or larger than the content it contains. If the grid is smaller, content will spill out. If it is larger, there will be a lot of wasted space at the bottom of the grid.
If we want our grid to auto-expand or shrink such that it contains it’s grid items, we should avoid giving it a fixed height.
",
188,How does the `dense` keyword affect the way items are implicitly added to the grid?,"FAQ,CSS FAQ",q-a,1,"
Question
How does the dense keyword affect the way items are implicitly added to the grid?
Answer
By default, items are placed sequentially within our grid, even if this creates “holes” or gaps in the grid. For example, say we have a 200px space at the end of a row but a 300px grid item. As this grid item is too large for the space, a new row will be created for the item. By default, the auto-placement algorithm will never backtrack to fill holes like this and the 200px gap will never be filled even if there exists smaller items that might fit there.
Applying the grid-auto-flow: dense; declaration changes this default behavior such that all grid items will be packed into the grid as tightly as possible. The algorithm will backtrack to see if a grid item might fit within a previously created hole. Note, this means that grid items might be placed out of order.
",
189,Do browser based developer tools work well with CSS Grid?,"FAQ,CSS FAQ",q-a,1,"
Question
Do browser based developer tools work well with CSS Grid?
Answer
Firefox has the best developer tools for inspecting and debugging CSS grid within the browser. Chrome’s DevTools will surely follow suite but for now, use FireFox to prototype your CSS grids in the browser.

190,If we are using external fonts do we need to also include fallback fonts in our stylesheet?,"FAQ,CSS FAQ",q-a,1,"

To hedge our bets against unintended incidents like this, use fallback fonts.

",
192,What are the pros and cons of using self-hosted fonts?,"FAQ,CSS FAQ",q-a,1,"
Question
What are the pros and cons of using self-hosted fonts?
Answer
Some of the pros of using a self-hosted font include:
1) Ownership of the web font license
2) The ability to subset fonts
3) The ability to buy the exact font you want
The main con to self-hosting a font is that it can be more expensive to purchase a web license to a font rather than paying a subscription fee for a hosted web font service like Typekit or Webtype. Of course, there are free font directories like Google Fonts. However, these directories may not have quite as many typefaces to choose from (although this is quickly changing) and they may not be as complete in terms of styling. For example, many typefaces in the Google Fonts directory only have one weight to choose from. What’s more, free typefaces may be overused which can dilute a company’ brand image.

194,"Can I change the border thickness, type, or color individually?","FAQ,CSS FAQ",q-a,1,"
Question
Can I change the border thickness, type, or color individually?
Answer
Definitely! With the border-width, border-style, and border-color longhand properties we can change the thickness, type, and color of the border individually.
We can change border thickness with the border-width property. For example:
border-width: 0.25rem; /*will set the border width on all sides to 0.25rem*/
We can change the border style (type) with the border-style property with values including solid, dotted, dashed, double, etc:
border-style: dotted; /*will set the border style to a dotted pattern*/
We can change the border color with the border-color property:
border-color: #FF5547; /*will set the border color to a red/orange color*/

Question
The link shared in step 2 of this exercise shows latin-ext and vietnamese rules. What are these rules and why do we only need the latin rule set?
Answer
Some typefaces in the Google Fonts directory support various character sets. For example, the latin rule set that you were instructed to select in this exercise supports most Western European languages (Spanish, French, German, etc.).
The latin-ext rule set supports many Eastern European languages and the vietnamese rule set supports the Vietnamese character set.

196,Can I use responsive units like em and rem for margin and padding?,"FAQ,CSS FAQ",q-a,1,"
Question
Can I use responsive units like em and rem for margin and padding?
Answer
We can use responsive units including em and rem for margin, padding, and other boundary and space properties like width.
We can use rem units for margin and padding when we want the margin and padding for an element to scale with the root font-size (the font-size set for the root, or <html>, element).
We can use em units for margin and padding when we want the margin and padding of an element to scale with the font-size of that particular element.

197,What is the difference between display: block; and display: inline;?,"FAQ,CSS FAQ",q-a,1,"
Question
What is the difference between display: block; and display: inline;?
Answer
Elements with display: block; will:

start on a new line
take up all available horizontal space - default width is the width of its container, not its content
not have any elements sitting to its left or right, by default
respect margin and padding on all sides
respect width and height when specified

Elements with display: inline; will:

not start on a new line
take up only as much horizontal space as necessary - the width of its content
will have other elements that are not set to display: block; sitting to its left and right
respect horizontal (left/right) margin and padding

not respect width and height


",
198,What other values are used on the position property?,"FAQ,CSS FAQ",q-a,1,"
Question
What other values are used on the position property?
Answer
The position property takes many useful values including relative - the other position values that you’ll use most often are:
position: absolute;

199,How do we use flexbox (`display: flex;`) to align elements vertically?,"FAQ,CSS FAQ",q-a,1,"
Question
How do we use flexbox (display: flex;) to align elements vertically?
Answer
When we use display: flex; on an element, called a flex-container, children elements nested inside, called flex-items, will align horizontally by default. To stack the flex-items vertically instead we can use flex-direction: column; on the flex-container.

Question
Are there other popular font directories aside from Google fonts?
Answer
Yes, there are. There are three main categories of sites where fonts can be obtained:
 1) Free font distributors like Font Squirrel, Dafont, Everything Fonts
    2) Paid font distributors like Fonts.com, Myfonts 
    3) Online fonts services like Google Fonts, Typekit

Note, font distributors in categories 1 and 2 will require that fonts be loaded directly into the stylesheet with the @font-face property. You will learn more about this property in the next exercise!

Question
What is an open-source font?
Answer
Open-source refers to a licensing type in which the source code or graphical assets are made available for study, modification, and redistribution. Open source work is often, but not always, free.
Luckily, Google Fonts give us a directory of typefaces that are both open source and free!

204,What other CSS best practices should I keep in mind (besides removing unused selectors)?,"FAQ,CSS FAQ",q-a,1,"
Question
What other CSS best practices should I keep in mind (besides removing unused selectors)?
Answer
Besides keeping your CSS free from unused selectors and declarations keep in mind some other best practices like:

making your CSS easy to read, this can be implemented by

using comments to describe logical groups of styling, for example a comment that describes a group of footer styling:



/* footer content */
footer {...}


keeping whitespace/indentation consistent by placing each selector and declaration on a new line, and indenting each declaration with 2 or 4 spaces:

h1,
h3 {
  color: yellow;
  text-transform: uppercase;
}



keeping your CSS DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) for more concise code, for example:

using class selectors to apply styles to multiple elements at once
using shorthand notation when possible (for properties like padding and margin)



using the separation of concerns principle to keep your CSS and HTML separate by:

avoiding the use of inline styles in HTML
avoiding the use of an internal stylesheet (the <style> element)

205,How many fallback fonts should I have?,"FAQ,CSS FAQ",q-a,1,"
Question
How many fallback fonts should I have?
Answer
We can have as many fallback fonts as we would like, however, each of our fallback fonts should be similar to our top font-family choice to make sure our web page looks as we intended, even when a font fails to load. We also want to make sure we have our last fallback font set to a generic font-family name (that is similar to our original font) in the case that none of our fonts load. For example:
p {
  font-family: ""Century Gothic"", Arial, sans-serif;
}

Do all serif fonts have a slanted serif similar to the font illustrated in this exercise?
Answer
No. Serif is a very general categorization of fonts which can be further broken down into the board categories of: Oldstyle, Modern, Slab Serif.
The slanted serifs seen in this exercise are characteristic of Oldstyle typefaces. Among other differences, Modern typefaces have thin, horizontal serifs whereas Slab Serif typefaces have thick, horizontal serifs.

209,"His exercise says that the unitless measure of `line-height is preferred since it is responsive. However, aren’t em units also responsive? Wouldn’t they automatically re-adjust like the unitless ratio value?","FAQ,CSS FAQ",q-a,1,"
Question
This exercise says that the unitless measure of `line-height is preferred since it is responsive. However, aren’t em units also responsive? Wouldn’t they automatically re-adjust like the unitless ratio value?
Answer
While ems are responsive units which will automatically re-adjust as our font sizes change, it is important for us to consider what these units are measured relative to and how our properties cascade down to child elements.
The main reason that the unitless value is preferred is because child elements will inherit the value itself, rather than the computed line height value. For example, say we have a <span> nested within a <p> element. Consider the following snippets:
p {
	font-size: 16px;
	Line-height: 1.5;
}

span {
	Font-size: 20px;
}

The computed line height value for our <p> text will be 16 * 1.5 = 24px. However, since we are using a unitless line-height value, the computed line height of our <span> text will be 20 * 1.5 = 30px. Now, if we had instead tacted em onto the end of the line-height property within our p selector, the <span> element would have inherited the computed line height of 24px.

Why in this exercise (Getting Started with Bootstrap), the links to the JavaScript libraries were written at the end of the <body> tag and not within <head>?

I’m recreating the Bootstrap painting Piet Mondrian’s  Composition II in Red, Blue, and Yellow by using 2 main columns instead of 2 rows as in the solution video. I think logically it can work this way but I’m not able to get the last f and g columns to be flush with column c above.
My code:
<div class=""container"">
      <div class=""row"">
        <div class=""col-3"">
          <div class=""row"">
            <div id=""a"" class=""col-12""></div>

How is the center determined? If the size of the screen changes, won’t the center shift?

when I edit the code to align in the center the code makes no change to the website on the right hand side of the screen.  I know that it’s right because I checked the solution.

Is the text-align property necessary for left-aligned text? Since the default alignment is already left, when should “text-align: left;” be used?




 elambrose13:

when should “text-align: left;” be used?


text-align is an inheritable property so if the parent has this property, all its children will inherit it. We won’t want the text content of the site to be center aligned, so the children that contain text will need to be left aligned.
Bottom line, if an element does not inherit center, right or justify alignment from a parent, then it’s safe to rely upon the default style sheet; i.e., text-align: left;.

This is from Layout with Flexbox. To test your change I added a middle to the markup.
  <h1>Middle</h1>
  <div class=""container"" id=""middle"">
    <div class=""side""></div>
    <div class=""center""></div>
    <div class=""side""></div>

and then in the CSS, add,
#middle .side {

#middle .center {

How is the CSS selector working properly on this example? In the html, the parent class names are:
class=“font-card garamond”
class=“creator”
However, in the CSS the selector is just:
.font-card .creator
What happened to “garamond” in the CSS and how is it working without it?

class=“font-card garamond”
This implies the element is a member of the classes “font-card” and “garamond”.  The space in between the class names describes that the element belongs to two different classes. In our css the rules for the selectors .font-card and .garamond are both applied to the element.

.font-card .creator
So in this case he is using one of the class names of the element (i.e .font-card) and nesting a child element reffered by the class name .creator to make the selection more specific.

218,Does the float property affect inline elements differently than block elements?,"FAQ,CSS FAQ",,6,"
Question
Does the float property affect inline elements differently than block elements?
Answer
When using the float property on display: inline; elements, the display value will be computed to block instead (display: block;). This means that display: inline; and display: block; elements will behave the same way when a float property is added to the element.
","
Hi!  I’m seeking clarification. I tested out some code using paragraph tags.  When I set the  float: left property, all of the paragraph blocks that are normally spaced out became inline.  Does this mean that by using float: left, the paragraph blocks now become inline?  It seems the opposite of the answer.  Am I reading this wrong?  The way I see it "" When using the  float  property on  display: block;  elements, the  display  value will be computed to  inline ""
Thanks in advance!




 msmargie:

the paragraph blocks now become inline?


No, they are still blocks. What happens is they are taken out of normal flow so that adjacent content can float around them. They appear inline since they all have the same relative reference, top/left, and multiple consecutive objects (with float) will have their own normal flow, as it were.
The object with the float property is not floating, per se, as mentioned above. Shrink and expand the window with a mix of objects that are out of normal flow, and a bunch of text (lorem ipsum is handy for doing layouts).
Notice how the objects will drop down to the next line when the window is narrowed.
Some old school tips for working with the float property:

always specify a fixed width in pixels and don’t set the height
always give those objects a parent; never use directly in the body

be sure to clear floats so they don’t impose on other content
write the margin on the object, not the floating adjacent content
don’t use padding
use simimlar content with the same height

Nothing is carved in stone, mind.

Thank you!  I was confused but this helped!

I noticed there are three CSS elements for the contact-btn:

.contact-btn {
float: right;
}
.contact-btn a {
margin-right: 30px;
padding: 8px 18px;
border: 1px solid #204156;
}
.contact-btn a:active {
position: relative;
bottom: 2px;
}

What do all of these do, aside from the first .contact-btn being the button itself?

The latter two are known generically as combinator selectors. The white space between the class selector and type selector tells CSS that a is a child element. Same applies to the latter with addition of a pseudo-class to a.

In this lesson we covered the way in which you can change the background color of text using the background-color property, but things tend to look kind of ugly if the background is just a solid color.
Is there any way to change the opacity of background colors?

you could use rgba (red, green, blue, alpha), where alpha is the o-capacity (from 0 (completely transparent) till 1 (solid))

Ah. Alright. So you would have the background-color property and its value would be rgba(…,…,…,0.5) or something like that, and you would just remove the opacity property altogether, correct?

yes, then it would just be rgb color (i need to type at least 20 characters, so i couldn’t just type yes  )

I’m wondering what the element here includes.
e.g. if I say that p { min-width: 300px; }  then it includes the paragraph text+its padding+its border+its margin? The whole package will be min. 300px wide?
many thanks,
Adam

no, it will only be the paragraph that will be min 300px wide, if we say you have a paragraph 200 px wide but with a padding of 18px, a border of 2px in width and a margin of 30px, your paragraph will be resized to 300px and therefore the box of that paragraph won’t be 300px wide but 400px wide

My code was
.grid {
  border: 2px blue solid;
  width: 400px;
  height: 500px;
  display: grid;
}

.box {
  background-color: beige;
  color: black;
  border-radius: 5px;
  border: 2px dodgerblue solid;
}

and the solution was
.grid {
  border: 2px blue solid;
  width: 400px;
  height: 500px;
  display: grid;
}

.box {
  background-color: beige;
  color: black;
  border-radius: 5px;
  border: 2px dodgerblue solid;
}

But somehow mine was wrong…? I’m working on a small screen so maybe I just can’t see it, but I can’t tell what difference there is between these two.

That’s weird – it looks like you did everything perfect.
Sometimes the Code Academy interface will ‘time out’ and I have to reload the page and run the code again for it to work.

What’s the difference between building a table and a grid?

Good day,
I tried to see what would happen if I did the unthinkable and made the total of grid-template-rows to be more than 100%, like so:
grid-template-rows 80% 40% 50px;
Apparently, it just expands the grid. Is there anything I should know about doing this or is it something I should just avoid in general?

I just tried this out, and from what I see it seems like what ever the % is describes what the height of the row would be in relation to the class width.
Such as if the class width is 400px and all three rows are 100% each row would be 400px in height. If I guess right the % & px on the grid-template-columns or grid-template-rows can be adjusted by adjusting there value off the class width. So 125% will give 500 px if the class width is 400px.

Here’s something :
@media only screen and (max-resolution: 150dpi) and (max-width: 480px) { }
This is for the first exercise of the “And Operator” section.
I typed the exact same code and clicked run,got an error. clicked for the solution,
compared my code and the system’s , exactly the same.

yeah, sometimes it happens, that’s why before clicking solution button, you wanna copy your code, refresh the page, paste it and run it to see what’s up

Codecademy is pretty unforgiving on typos I have had them where an extra space has caused me to not get the check mark but the code still runs. Its probably a good thing. In the long run. I have definitely become more vigilant of typos because of this.

Is it important that the max-resolution rule is written before the max-width rule? I’m getting an error if I write it with max-width first.

Why are we using specific design classes like cursive and capitalize on the HTML? If you wanted to change the skin or design of this document you will have to change the HTML as well and change those classes, as opposed to giving them sections and only touch the CSS to give it a different look? Isn’t it better to just give HTML sections IDs and change what they look with ease on the CSS instead of changing the HTML?

How come the h1 font is changing to comic sans in part 5 of this exercise, not cursive? I entered the css class selector of
.cursive {
font-family: cursive;
}
and the HTML element for h1 contains class=“title cursive capitalize”
but the h1 text changes to what looks like comic sans, definitely not cursive. BUT I’m getting a check mark as though I’ve done it correctly…??

A little late on the reply but it doesn’t change to cursive for me either. My guess is that font isn’t recognized anymore for some reason.

So in chapter 11 i.e, Specificity the 4th instruction tells us to add “.captalize” class which has text-transform: capitalize;
What is this command actually doing, because I can’t see any dchanges in the page text after running this command.

You simply styled a class that wasn’t assigned to any element that is why you didn’t see any changes.
In instruction no.5 you are assigning the class to an element so you should see changes at this step.

I meant in the 5th step itself, if you observe the instruction states that the text become capital.But the text was already in the same format even before we gave the command. So what is the difference after giving that command.

In step five you were commanded to replace uppercase with capitalize
The text should have been like this because of the uppercase: TOP VACATION SPOTS
Capitalize would look like this: Top Vacation Spots
I do note that the original text in HTML follows the rules of capitalize which isn’t the best way to show an example, I will it forward to change it.
<h1 class=""title uppercase"">Top Vacation Spots</h1> 


When style gets over-ridden with another style that takes precedence, does it over-ride everything, or just the attributes that are changed? say a class selector specifies a color and font size, and an id selector for the same specifies a new color, does the class-level font size remain?

Why would anyone use one ID selector to override another ID selector? Wouldn’t it be better to just modify the first ID selector’s declarations?

I just did the testings. It doesn’t override everything, just the propety values (not attributes).
In other words, the class-level font-size would remain.
Note: you called them attributes, but they are property values. Attributes are from HTML, not CSS. You can check the CSS syntax here:



MDN Web Docs



Syntax
The basic goal of the Cascading Stylesheet (CSS) language is to allow a browser engine to paint elements of the page with specific features, like colors, positioning, or decorations. The CSS syntax reflects this goal and its basic building blocks...

Question
What is the preferred way of including CSS within a project? How do I know when to
Use inline styles, the  tags, or a .css file?
Answer
As a web developer you will eventually come across HTML documents which include CSS either inline with style attributes or within the <style> tags at the head of the document. Hence, it is important to be aware of all the various ways to include CSS in a project.
That having been said, mashing HTML and CSS together is not a great habit to get into. As developers we want to “separate our concerns” because this usually creates codebases that are more flexible, readable, and maintainable. As such, keeping our CSS contained within a separate .css file is the preferred way of including CSS within most projects.
For a deeper dive into some of the nuances here, take a look at this article.

It would be nice if you could add to “the new css file” the information that it is found above the code interface next to the index.html file. I know this might seem obvious but to the visually impaired, i.e. code/text/ focused I did not understand where that file was located in virtual space… and was searching for it in the code itself. 

@alyssavigil, still as important a concern today as when this was first posted.

Why did the post section of the html overflow its parent(blog)?

It seems that setting height and width in pixels rather than % is going to cause problems on different devices displays etc.  Is there ever a time when you should use pixels or is it recommended to always use percentage for width and height?

Same question. If there’s seemingly no padding/margin/border, why would it overflow when you’re setting it to a % of the parent?

Same question I was using box-sizing:border-box and I had 2 divs next to each other
div 1 has width: 100px
div 2 has width: 100%
with both using float left but for some reason div 2 always shows under div 1 instead of next to div 1 and filling it in. What do I do? (div 1 has a border of 1px solid)

Hi @cssplayer91911 
Have you set display: inline-block in CSS?

I am having a difficult time understanding how using relative measurements (especially the EM and REM measurements for text) does anything for responsive design. Here’s my problem: I understand that EM is calculated relative to parent size and REM is calculated relative to the root size.
BUT
… since both the parent size and root size are set in pixels, how does converting other measurements into EM and REM change anything?
Are we missing a next step here? For example … will there be a step where we learn to define either the parent or root default differently for different types of screens?

I’m confused as to what is happening in step 1 of this exercise, and hoping someone can enlighten me please?
As per step 1, I added display:flex; at line 90.  When I do this, the pictures swap from being arranged in rows to columns, but I don’t understand why.  I had assumed I would need to make the .col div’s flex-boxes and set their flex-direction to column to achieve this.
I’m guessing I’m missing something fundamental about block vs inline.
Any clues would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks.
style.css.txt (1.4 KB)

Hi there,
When you set the display: flex at Step 1, you create a flex container but this flex container holds the columns, and not the pictures. This Step 1 takes the .col’s and stacks them on the top-left of the .cards container.
Later you deal with the .col class where you play with the images.
In other words, here we speak about the last topic of the course - nested flex boxes.
I hope this answers the quesiton.

I was wondering what is the difference between using




display: flex
with
flex-wrap: wrap
compared to




display: inline-flex
Don’t both result in a container with children that will adjust themselves according to the width of the screen?

I still don’t understand. The columns seem to be in-line, but we used the code display: flex. Shouldn’t the containers loos like rows from top to bottom?

overflow: scroll;  creates two scroll bars in my browser, even if only (for example) the vertical one is needed. It’s not ideal aesthetically. How do I create only a vertical scroll bar?




 tommeetstom:

How do I create only a vertical scroll bar?


Yes, but there is also a way to create only the scrollbar needed, when and if needed.
overflow: auto;

In the text for this exercise, in number 9 it gives possible values for the overflow property of display, hide and scroll. Shouldn’t this be visible, hidden and scroll?
I thought maybe they were alternatives, but https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/overflow doesn’t mention display or hide.
I also tried using overflow: hide; but it didn’t seem to work - whereas overflow: hidden; did work.

I’ve invited the Community Manager to have a look at this and refer it to the dev team for correction of the narrative.

.share {
  border: 1px solid LightGrey;
  padding: 20px 0px;
  position: relative;
  text-align: center;
  width: 100%;
}

.share a {
  background: red;
  border: 1px solid red;
  border-radius: 3px;
  color: white;
  display: inline-block;
  margin: 10px;
  padding: 15px;
  text-decoration: none;
}

2 questions here:


Under .share, padding is set to 0px at the sides but the borders of my light grey box go all the way to the ends of the browser. From my understanding, wouldn’t 0 padding at the sides lead to the grey box ending right where the red buttons are?


Again under .share, does position: relative serve to create a “base” for the buttons in .share a? So the margin of 10px is for the buttons in relation to the grey box?



Not a response, but a question… Where is the width and height inherited from?



 smallfurrr:

does position: relative serve to create a “base” for the buttons in .share a?


The best element to have that property assigned is the parent. All you’re trying to do is break out of the inherited default  static property of the body. The children will be relative to the parent, not the document.body.

When the CSS cheat sheet will be available :((( ?

That’s the same question I had a couple of days ago! Thank you for asking.

Why does the lesson keep referring to RGB colors as “decimal” colors? Isn’t that quite confusing since hex colors are also “hexadecimal”? Where does the decimal come in anyway?

That is weird. It speaks to a confirmation bias of the lesson author. All we need to do is squeak past that and put it into our own perspective. Rear view mirror.

when they say they are equivalent, do they mean none is better than the other?. cause they obviously don’t mean interchangeable. or do they mean they can express the same number of colors?.

Using RGB , you have 256^3 different colors you can choose form, Using Hash, you have 16^6 different colors you can choose from. Both equal 16,777,216 colors. So yes,they express the same number of colors.

Can someone explain this exercise to me? I don’t get it…
repeat(3, 1fr) / 3fr 50% 1fr;
How does this end up being 7 rows and 1 column?

There is 3 rows and 3 columns.

it’s probably creating 7 rows, because you are using codecademy HTML template with 7 divs. Check your HTML code,  7 items 

but can we combine “repeat” with Grid Template to optimize the code?
or it’s only for rows/columns:
grid-template-rows: repeat(4, 50% 150px 150px);
grid-template-columns: repeat(44, 1fr);

thanks
PS: grid-template: repeat(12, 1fr) / repeat(6, 1fr);

So like, I wasn’t able to complete the exercise on my own because I thought the repeat function was only for rows/columns.  But when I got the solution, apparently it works for Grid Template to optimize the code.

There are three rows. The first row has 3 items. The second row has 3 items. The third row has 1 item.
Each item is represented by a   <div>     in the HTML code.

It is simply a shortcut.

grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 20px 50px)
“This code will create four columns where the first and third columns will be 20 pixels wide and the second and fourth will be 50 pixels wide.” This from the curriculum.
It seems intuitive that this would produce 4 columns of 20, 20, 50, 50 but the answer says that we don’t move sequentially from left to right when we use the repeat function. We treat the 20px and 50px like a pair and repeat the pair?

What repeats is the space separated sequence following the count value. There is only one comma in that expression. Repeat 20px 50px means the distribution will be 20px 50px 20px 50px …

in the “block display” exercise: Why should it be repeated in the footer style that the text should be centered if it is already marked in the h3 style?

please how can i get these code editor that display code on the web. like the one we using

I feel like the statement in this lesson that “block-level elements fill the entire width of the page by default” is misleading?
e.g. in the lesson, if we do:
.question {
  width: 80%;
}

.answer {
  width: 100%;
}

then the answer divs also take up 80% of the width of the page (as you might expect, since question is their parent).
It could equally be that we set the body to be 80% to get the same behaviour from the answer div (and all those parenting it).

Wouldn’t it be more accurate to say that block-level elements fill the entire width of their parent element by default?

Maybe you can try CodePen or JSFiddle.
CodePen:  [https://codepen.io/]
JSFiddle: [https://jsfiddle.net/]

Thanks, these sites are premiums ,
I have found bracket live previews

But if you set a narrower width for a child element, it will override the parent element.
Remember: specificity always takes precedence.

Why inline Elements Which are Absolutely or Relatively Positioned Behave as Block-level Elements?

When the answers are floated left, why do they appear inline with some of the questions?

b9e2422d2b64c22a911baad5f78c97aa3c2dcd8d.png664×567 29.9 KB


On the .question's, include a clear: both; (or left) property and that should fix it. Above, the float is still in effect.
We should consider how the term float came into being. It is an old typography term that refers not to the element itself, but the surrounding content. float: left; says the content will float around the object to the left of it. This permits that object to remain in normal flow. Repeated float: left; will appear inline.
Compare this to an absolutely positioned object on the left. Content will not float around it, but will have the same relative top, left reference, so will be partially obscured by that object.

I just tried this and when the answers are floated to the left, the agree and disagree switch places…why?

Are your answers marked up like so,
    <div class=""answer"">
      <h3>Disagree</h3>
    </div>

    <div class=""answer"">
      <h3>Neutral</h3>
    </div>

    <div class=""answer"">
      <h3>Agree</h3>
    </div>

?
When they are all given a float: left property, they will retain normal flow and appear in the order they are tagged. However, if they are given a float: right property they will be reversed, and bound to the right margin, rather than the left. Be sure to set clear: both on the .question if you want to test this.

Thank you mtf, I did set clear: both on the question class but it still switches places when I set float to right or left (.answer)
The lesson states:    “right  - this value will move elements as far right as possible.” So I don’t understand why don’t they just move to the right instead of switching places…
I will keep reading and researching 




 primavera91:

don’t understand why don’t they just move to the right instead of switching places


When we float to the right, the normal flow is reversed since the first element gets drawn first, so it will go to the far right. The second will get drawn, so will be ine middle, the third element gets drawn last, so will be the leftmost.
In the old days, when we combine float: left and float:right to the same row of elements, we would always float: right, first, then float left second. Dig around for some articles form the early days, 1998 - 2004 era for more discussion on this. A lot has changed since then so I cannot say if this rule of thumb still applies.

edit 190213: to

more explanation on this word. “This works for static and relative positioned elements.”

In this lesson, it is stated that “Floated elements must have a width specified”. However, in the exercise, we apply a ‘float’ property to the “.answer” elements, which do not have a width specified. Why is this the case?

It may be the case that the browser is calculating the width based on content, but I won’t defend this answer. A width is necessary to aid the browser in determining how much space to take out of normal flow to accommodate the float.
Recall that the object with that property is not floating, but the content is floating around it. This takes calculation on the browser’s part.

If you set the .answer divs to float:left, this is what happens

Screen Shot 2019-09-18 at 08.47.38.PNG1471×500 36.5 KB

That’s a really difficult behavior to understand based on the information in the course.
Just from observing this behaviour, all I can figure is that if you float an inline-block element left, then place a block element after it. The normal behviour of the block element to start a new line is prevented.  The block elements still have line breaks after them, but not before.
Is that right? It’s really weird.

scratch that, that can’t be right, because if you float them to the right, this happens:

Screen Shot 2019-09-18 at 09.10.36.PNG1481×524 37.7 KB

What’s going on? Is it that if you float an inline-block element in either direction, other elements ignore the vertical space they take up or something?

This was posted a while ago, but I imagine other people will be looking for this answer, because the lesson is really unclear about this.
It works because inline-block elements set their width based on the content within them, so you don’t need to specify the width explicitly.
What I think they’re trying to explain in the lesson is that you can float block elements as well, but only if you specify the width. So if you were to write something like a blog post, and you wanted a picture with text wrapped around it, you can introduce it (along with a caption) in a block container like a div, set the width explicitly and float it either left or right. The text would then wrap around it in the same way as it does if you set a picture positioning to ‘wrap text’ rather than ‘inline’ in MSword.
Maybe inline-block is a newer display type and that piece of advice in the lesson is left over from before they existed.




 davethecamel:

the lesson is really unclear about this


Bit of a pun, that. The solution to this problem requires that we clear floats before each new row of elements. If that instruction has not surfaced, yet, then it will follow immediately.

Thanks, I think I eventually figured out what’s going on.
The use of clear is shown in the next lesson, but the why and how of it is not explained. It’s looks like it’s something to do with what float was designed for, which I’m guessing is wrapping text around pictures as you might in an article.
It seems to me that float is not really the right tool for a situation like this. You’d probably want to use align: left wouldn’t you?

Normal flow defaults to left alignment, but block level elements take a new line. float creates a break in normal flow that ends up keeping all floated elements on the same line. The clear property is how we restore normal block flow.
It takes some practice and experimentation to get a handle on using float but it is time well spent. Don’t be discounting this technique.

Atom reports an error in style css. The error reads:
"" float can’t be used with display: inline-block.""
Why is that?




 java6775471868:

Why is that?


float takes its element out of normal flow so any display property on that same element will be ignored.

239,Why use display: flex;?,"FAQ,CSS FAQ",q-a,3,"
Question
Why use display: flex;?
Answer
We can use flexbox, setting a container element to display: flex;, when we want to easily layout, align, and space items within said container in a single (horizontal or vertical) direction.
Some great use cases for flexbox:

laying out a collection of items vertically or horizontally, including dimensions and space between items
easily aligning items horizontally or vertically

","
If I set display: inline; in .gallery-item, then also I get the same effect ! But than how to align content in center ? Justify-content: center;  inside .gallery doesn’t work here ?

The reason being the absence of the flexbox. When using the flex command you are manipulating the flexbox and not the content inside. Think of it like organizing beads inside a cloth bag by manipulating the cloth bag(a rough analogy) as opposed to arranging the beads individually.

I’ve had a play around with the code for this lesson to explore the use of the position, display and float properties. I’ve ended up with a few questions (see further below) about how I’ve attempted to style the section which includes the survey questions and their answer options. This corresponds to the HTML content originally contained within the 5 <div class=""question"">  elements, but I’ve now included all of this code within one single <main> parent element.
I’ve included my HTML code for this section below but, first, here’s an overview of my amendments and some of the reasons for them:
Within <main>, I’ve contained each question section (heading and text) and each answer section (the 3 options) within their own <section class=""block""> element, because I want to display the answer options alongside each question (rather than beneath). I thought I could achieve this by arranging them across the page as inline blocks. As there are further styling differences between how I need to display the question blocks and the answer blocks (yet uniformity amongst all question blocks and all answer blocks), I have given the question blocks the double class value ""block question"" and the answer blocks the double class value ""block answers"". This allows me to display both question blocks and answer blocks as inline blocks, and also create a subdivision to style question blocks differently from  answer blocks. I’ve included the relevant CSS below the HTML.
<main>
  <section class=""block question"">
    <h4>Question 1</h4>
    <h2>Question Statement</h2>
  </section>
    
  <section class=""block answers"">
    <div class=""answer"">
      <h3>Disagree</h3>
    </div>

    <div class=""answer"">
      <h3>Neutral</h3>
    </div>

    <div class=""answer"">
      <h3>Agree</h3>
    </div>
  </section>

  <!-- continues here with the same code for questions/answers 2-5 -->
</main>


body {
  text-align: center;
  margin: 0;
}

main {
  position: absolute;
  top: 280px;
  left: 110px;
  <!-- This offset position is to account for:
    (i) a fixed navigation menu: width 110px; runs the full length of
        the page on the left; and
    (ii) a fixed 'Welcome' section: height 280px; at the top of the
         page. -->
  z-index: 2;
  <!-- This z-index value allows the <main> 'question and answer'
  section to scroll over the fixed 'Welcome' section. -->
  background-color: white;
  padding: 10px;
}

.block {
  display: inline-block;
  float: left;
}

.block.question {
  box-sizing: border-box;
  width: 65%;
  height: 250px;
  padding: 0 10px;
}

.block.answers {
  box-sizing: border-box;
  width: 35%;
  height: 250px;
  padding: 20px 0 10px 10px;
}

.answer {
  border: 1px solid #466995;
  margin: 10px;
}

<!-- In my full CSS, the CSS rule sets for the elements which render the
text for the questions and answers do not contain any additional
declarations affecting box-model dimensions (i.e. there are no 
additional values for margin, padding, border, width or height other 
than those included in the CCS rule sets above). -->


Questions


Is my use of double classes correct? Specifically, by having the 2 double classes of ""block question"" and ""block answers"" in the HTML, does that mean that I can create CSS rules with (i) selector .block which applies to both of the double classes; and (ii) selector .block.question or block.answers which each apply to just one of the double classes?


Adding the declaration float: left; to the .block selector rule set allowed me to obtain a much better horizontal alignment between the content of each question and its answers (both in their own separate inline block). This really happened by accident, through trial and error, as I was experiencing a lot of difficulty with this before experimenting with float. Why is this? I don’t understand why using float improves the alignment here…


Before adding float, I wasn’t able to enter width % values totalling 100% and still keep 2 blocks ( a question and its three answer options) together horizontally across the page.
e.g.  .block.question {width: 65%;} + .block.answers {width: 35%} resulted in each set of answers being rendered below its question; whereas reducing the % slightly for one of them (say 35% to 30%) worked.
Purely by chance, when I added the float property (as in the code above) I didn’t have this problem anymore. Why is this?


Apologies, if this isn’t the right place to ask questions which go into so much detail. If it isn’t, could you let me know where would be better, and if I need to set out my queries in a different way e.g. more succintly. Thanks! 

I would like to second @jon_morris in his points, as well as ask another pointed question:
This section of lessons - in particular, the display and position properties - were rather confusing overall. While reviewing the available code I was trying to understand how the “Relative” position operated, and was surprised to see that removing this declaration from the .welcome class indicated to the generated page that this <div> was meant to be at the top of the page, just like the <header>. Is this strictly due to the HTML structure, of which <header> and <div> are not communicating actual structured elements to the browser (such a <p> or <h#>?

@pelirrojop
In the situation you are querying, is the <header> styled with a fixed position?
(As I’ve altered the code for this lesson, I can’t see what the different elements’ position properties were originally set to.)
If it is fixed, then this element has been removed from the normal flow, and so the <div class=""welcome""> will occupy the first position (at the top of the page).  Before scrolling, this won’t be visually apparent if the <div> has a relative position which offsets and positions it as if the <header> wasn’t in fact fixed. However, if you remove its relative position (effectively defaulting to static position) it will now appear at the top of the page and overlapping with the <header> (assuming of course that the <header> has been fixed at the top of the page).
static and relative :

Position elements within the normal flow, with relative allowing an element’s position to be offset without affecting the position of other elements.


absolute and fixed :

In contrast, these remove elements from the normal flow, which in turn affects the position of the other elements.
The difference between the two is that a fixed position is not affected by scrolling, whereas an absolute position moves with scrolling.

Check out https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/position, especially this section.
I hope that helps to answer your question. However, if your code (and position properties) are different to what I’ve assumed, let me know what you’re working with, and I’ll have another go at an explanation 

How can we know where to use padding and where to use positioning rules

We should use padding when we want to give an element more space between its content and its border - example: adding padding on a paragraph element when we don’t want the paragraph text to touch the border of the paragraph element.
We should use margin to give space between elements - example: we have two <img> elements next to each other but we don’t want them touching.

Why change the old box model, with the border-box? I mean in what example this would be useful?

I had a similar question, I’m confused how this differs from the original box model we learned. Is it just for simplicity?

Similar question: what’s the advantage of using the old box model?

I just started this section, but from what I understand the old box model if an element is declared width of 200px with a padding of 20px and a border of 1px, the total width of the p1 box becomes 242px.
If you change the box-sizing to border-box, and the width is defined as 200px with the same values for padding and border, as mentioned above, the box size would remain at 200px. That means the content size decreases in order to maintain overall box width to 200px.
I think it’s useful, considering you are able to work with whole clear numbers, instead of having to fiddle around with something that is 242px wide compared to 200px wide.
I could be wrong, if I am i’d love to know  that I am. From reading and looking at the diagram for border-box box model, that was the conclusion I came to.

Put this code into Visual Studio Code or the Code Academy interface:
<style>

    .earth {
       border: 5px solid black;
       height: 200px;
       width: 300px;
       padding: 20px;
    }
    
    
    .mars {
       border: 5px solid black;
       height: 200px;
       width: 300px;
       padding: 20px;
       box-sizing: border-box  
    }
    
</style>
    
    <h1 class=""earth"">Hello Earth!</h1>
    
    <h1 class=""mars"">Hello Mars!</h1>


Play around with the padding and border size in the .earth  class, observe how the box gets bigger.
Then, fiddle with the padding and border size in the .mars class, observe how the box does not get bigger.
Do you see how this might be useful?
p.s. This code should all go into an HTML file.

Is margin used with Box Model: Border-Box?  If so, is it configured outside of the border/specified width as with the Content-Box, and is it collapsing?

Border-box should set the Width an Height for all the Html elements to fixed , but when writing something like this code below where the padding exceeds a certain value (in this case it starts from 100px) it starts to modify the real width and height of the elements.
* {
   box-sizing: border-box;
}

h1 {
   border: 3px solid black;
   height: 200px;
   width: 300px;
   padding: 300px;       <--- 
}
How is that possible ??

Why wasn’t the old box model made like the border-box example from the beginning? If it is more useful, why is in it updated?

In the example shown in this exercise wouldn’t it be easier to just apply the color and font-weight properties to the h2 selector rather than applying two separate classes to the opening <h1> tag?

Is going back and editing your html to make your css work the way you want it to, a common practice?

Common practice? No, not really. The idea is to make the CSS work for a given HTML document, not the reverse. This is where implementation needs to match with an adequate structural plan.
It all stems from the document so that is the house to have in order, before bringing in the decorators.
In order of importance,

HTML
CSS
ES

That’s from a development stance. I place HTML at the top of food chain not just for structural purposes, but also for accessibility hardening. Work with the raw user interface and iron out all the critical areas in that state.
Now we can bring in CSS. This step may require adding more structure to the HTML, and in today’s terms, most definitely. Changes in structure should always be run through the accessibility test suite at each stage to ensure that aspect of the UI is not corrupted.
Of course we’re going to come back to our HTML to give a wire-frame for our design layout. CSS will let us weave whatever tapestry we desire to fill in the empty space. It’s almost moot the role that HTML plays by this point. Valid, well-formed, accessible, tangible outline, self-documenting, … Once we reach all those pinnacles we can put the HTML to bed.
The CSS must work with the structure it is given. It follows that the structure takes into account resizing for different devices so that media queries render correctly. That notwithstanding, we should be free to style in any number of ways to our heart’s delight without ever touching the HTML, again.

Thanks, @mtf great analogy. I see where you’re coming from. It outlines what I need to do. I’m working on a couple of webpages of my own as I learn. I  think I’m going to have to scrap them and start over. The more CSS I learn shows me that my Html is not going to be anywhere near what it needs to be.

In the exercise, I have erased the “title” from the “class” and added “uppercase” and it turned like specified in the CSS sheet. But the exercise didn’t turn itself into “checked”. I clicked on Solution and the right code was: class=“title uppercase” and not class=“uppercase” as I have written it. My question is if both are ok to use or we need to specify exactly for each class (ex: class=“destination bold green” or class=“green bold”). Thank you!




 amaliaa.3092516670:

class=“title uppercase”


Those are concurrent classes that point to two different rulesets, both of which will be applied to this element.

Have you tried this out to see what result you get?

I just finished the lesson on specificity! Thanks for responding though.

I just have one question.
Wouldn’t it be easier to leave only “title” as a value of this class, and to tape this in CSS code :
.title {
color: teal;
text-transform: uppercase;
}
So you can change all-in-one the two by using only only one value to the class attribute ?
PS : Sorry if my english is not perfect, I’m french, I hope it’s understandable.

It occurs to me that different tag types–say, p and h1–might come to have the same class name, but that we would want to treat them differently because they generally serve different functions on a web page.
Should I avoid using identical class names with different tag types? Or is there a way to write CSS such that it understands that the following HTML tags should be treated differently?
<p class=""placeholder""></p>
<h1 class=""placeholder""></h1>


I think I found a way. The CSS code would look something like:
p.placeholder {}
h1.placeholder {}

Is this bad practice? Is there a more elegant way to do this?




 course9433075610:

Should I avoid using identical class names with different tag types?


No, that is why we have classes, so they can be applied across the whole range of types, either collectively or by type.



 course9433075610:

Is this bad practice? Is there a more elegant way to do this?


Perfectly valid practice. The thing to avoid is duplication, so any common properties should apply to the generic class selector rule, and special properties to each type.class selector.
.placeholder {}
p.placeholder {}
h1.placeholder {}


Can we separate classes in class attribute using commas? Or is it strictly spaces only?




 mukhtark01:

Can we separate classes in class attribute using commas?


No, we cannot use commas. The spaces are separators. The names are not in a sequence.
class=""red green blue""

Chances are that if we use commas, the browser will only see the first class, red and ignore the others. Or the class attribute will be ignored outright.
Try this…
<html>
<head>
<title>Class Test</title>
<style>
.red { color: red; }
.green { background-color: lightgreen; }
.blue { border: 2px solid darkblue; }
</style>
</head>
<body>
<p class=""red, green, blue"">Text should be red, background should be green, border should be blue.</p>
</body>
</html>


Looks like only the blue class is applied and the red and green classes are ignored.
Let’s try removing one of the commas.
class=""red green, blue""


Looks like only the red and blue class are applied and the green ignored.
Taking out the other comma…

From the above we can conclude that the parsing engine sees the comma as a mis-typed class name, not a punctuation mark. The classes that don’t have a comma are applied, no matter where they occur in the order.

From what I gained from the exercise it would “easier” to do it your way, however I think the exercise is simply showing us how to add another attribute to it, for example if we had another class=“title” that we didn’t want to add that extra attribute to

The instructions in this section where you set the min-height make it seem like your text is supposed to spread out a bunch when you stretch your browser window before you set min-height to 200px.  Maybe I’m just not stretching enough (maybe I don’t have a large enough monitor?) but the text is still staying close and legible without setting min-height: 200px.  I think it’s because earlier in the lesson we set #blog .post to have width: 52% which is what I’m guessing is keeping the text from spreading out too much.  I would appreciate anyone’s input on this

I agree with you. The example should have a min hight of 500px so everyone could see the example. I am able to see it in my big screen, but i am not able to see it in the small one.

I have noticed sometimes that in CSS programs, fonts in the font-family section are in single-quotes. Why is that so?

Single-quotes, double-quotes, it’s a matter of preference.
But if you really care, this is what Google recommends: https://google.github.io/styleguide/htmlcssguide.html#CSS_Quotation_Marks

Hi there,
When changing the font to Palatino on the main CSS page, we included ‘Palatino Linotype’ in the brackets as well as the backup font.  What was the reason behind this and what was the impact on the function.
Thanks,

Forgive me.
This may be something I need to review in CSS intro, but when trying to apply padding px to the bottom of the list of elements, it doesn’t apply. However, when adding it between the border and border-radius element it seems to work just fine. Can someone please explain this? Is this an “order of operations” rule? Thank You!
https://www.codecademy.com/paths/web-development/tracks/getting-more-advanced-with-design/modules/learn-css-box-model/lessons/box-model-intro/exercises/box-padding-i

What is the default padding if it is not specified?

Let’s say I set the padding of a box to 20px, but I one of the sides to a different value of px… Will that one side rule over the padding? If so, is that the general rule?

The default border is medium none color. This means it just won’t show up because of the none, but if you only substitute the none with a type of border, then you’ll see that the default medium width and color (same as the text color) will automatically be there as default. See exercise 4.

Whats is the difference between Hexadecimal colors and just colors by names and when to use which?

well, Hexadecimal colors allows us to choice from 16 million colors (255 shades of red, green and blue), while the there are only a couple dozen of color keywords.

Assuming we’re happy using some or all of the colours from keywords (and don’t need the extra choice), is there any advantage to using the hexcode instead?

to make a good looking website, i don’t think you can get away with just the color keyword, that are only a handful.

I’ve noticed that often times in the lessons, h3 or even h4 tags will be styled in css to have larger font sizes than the h2’s.
Is this an oversight or an example of using html tags for there semantic meaning as opposed to their styling?

The lesson states:

Keep in mind that all three character hex colors can be represented with six characters (by repeating each character twice) but the same is not true in reverse.

I’m confused about what is being referred to with but the same is not true in reverse. Isn’t the whole point that it IS true in reverse? That those three colours can be represented with three OR six characters?




 text4809337021:

That those three colours can be represented


It isn’t talking about three colors. It is referring to “three-character hex colors”. For all hex colors whose number pairs are the same characters (such as #000000 or #11AACC or #CCDD55 or #AA3377 and many more), you have a choice: You can either write them as six characters or you can shorten them into the equivalent three-character representation (i.e. #000, #1AC, #CD5, #A37 for the examples I just cited earlier).
So three-character hex colors can be written as six-character hex codes, but the reverse isn’t necessarily true. There are many six-character hex colors which can’t be shortened into three-character representation. For example, #1A9D3F or #3195B2 and so on. These colors don’t have same-character number pairs.

Ah okay. I figured that was kinda obvious since the whole per-requisite for using 3 character hex colours was that their 6 character variants had repetition so I thought this was getting at something else. Appreciate the clarification!

I’ve just noticed that my misstyping:
img {
height: 150px;
margin: 0 auto;
border-radius: 5pc;
}

works to create a perfect circle and each integer between 0pc and 5pc makes a progressively more rounded shape.
pc Picas 1pc = 1/6th of 1in

on this task of “Height and Width” it asks you to add height: 700px; into CSS however I am confused why it changes the size of the image rather than the text inside the  tag??

because the banner takes care of the entire space, including the image. if you would want to change the actual text, then you would have to go to #banner .content h1. (because h1 is the text) and change the size there




 saalr:

#banner .content h1


That much specificity is not required. Ideally we should work with the least specificity possible so upgrades and mods are simpler. If there is only one H1 in the page, or in the case of there being more than one if you want them all the same size then,
body {
  font-size: 100%;
}
h1 {
  font-size: 1.5rem;
}

The first rule above is to accept the base font size set by the user. Then the H1 is relative to that. A default H1 is 2rem (about 32px).

i get my paragraph aligned to the left when i make it   width:30 px;. but when i make it 350 (which is a lot more) i get it normally as a paragraph . how come?

on this task of “Height and Width” it asks you to add height: 700px; into CSS however I am confused why it changes the size of the image rather than the text ? I cleared everything in style.css and wrote new codes, and it still didnt change. please help!!!

Again, I can barely read the text on the sample website.  The contrast between the text and the background is minimal. If it’s just another website out there, I wouldn’t care and just not go back to that website.
But since this is set as an example for the Codecademy learner, I think the instructor should use user a better example (or just make the text a few shares darker). I am a girl, and I do think it looks pretty and all. But functionality should trump appearance, especially in this case. If I can’t read the text, I won’t care how pretty the site looks.

We do have control over this in the p selector rule. Try, #4d4d4d.
As an aside, the author appears to have used color names that the syntax highlighter does not recognize (but that the browser might).
.byline {
  border-bottom: 1px solid LightGrey;
  border-top: 1px solid LightGrey;
  color: Darkgrey;
  font-size: 14px;
  font-weight: 200;
}

Notice the names are in the same red-orange as the rest of the text. Changing the names as follows,
.byline {
  border-bottom: 1px solid Lightgray;
  border-top: 1px solid Lightgray;
  color: Darkgray;
  font-size: 14px;
  font-weight: 200;
}

and now they are the blue gray we would anticipate.

Darkgray

In place of Darkgray, try #333333.

Awesome! Thank you, Roy! You’re always so responsive and provide great feedback!

You’re welcome; and, thank you!

Just to confirm with this topic, when you set the height or width of an element, you’re setting the element’s CONTENT area, not the total height or width of the element itself ???

The following code changes the size of the container, but not the content within: (key code marked with asterisks)
#banner {
  background-image: url(""https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/courses/web-101/unit-6/htmlcss1-img_tahoe.jpeg"");
  background-size: cover;
  background-position: bottom center;
  *width: 100%;*
  *height: 700px;*
}

If you wanted to change the dimensions of the content within the container you do this: (key code marked with asterisks)
#banner .content h1 {
  position: relative;
  top: 50px;
  margin: 0 auto;
  *width: 400px;*
}

Now the text has been crammed into a narrower space. Note that the letters themselves did not change size. To effect this, use the property font-size: followed by the value in px, em, rem, etc.

In the code the width in #banner is set to 100%. What does that mean?




 pysurfer78186:

What does that mean?


It means full width of the viewport, or full width of the parent element, which ever case may apply.
.parent {
    width: 400px;
}
.child {
    width: 100%;
}

The child element in this case will also be 400px wide.

The lesson tells us that if we set the width/height in px, what will fill a laptop screen would overflow a mobile device screen. That leads me to believe that it really isn’t the ideal way to do it. Now that most people do the majority of their web browsing on a mobile device, is there something that allows you to code for all size screens? A one size fits all type?

Why when we increase the height seems it’s growing downwards at the bottom of the content? 
image1366×768 280 KB

It does not makes sense based on the diagram because height mark up at top and the bottom of the content: (Why that happens? And how makes sense?)

image1366×768 58.2 KB


I’m a little confused here, do the Height and Width property define dimensions of the element’s box or the content area?

Content area. According to the box model, border and margin are outside of this region. Padding is, however, inside and will have possibly undesired effects, hence I suggest caution or total avoidance.

Hi Team,
Looking at the css code of this exercise I cannot find a rule that would set the  <h1>The Best Coffee Regions</h1> font family as it is displaying in my browser.
The only rule related to this heading seems to be the following:
.header {

  background-image: url(https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1455267847942-f4fdb784f0c5?dpr=1&auto=format&crop=entropy&fit=crop&w=1500&h=1000&q=80&cs=tinysrgb);

  height: 400px;

  background-position: center center;

}

But is seems to only set a background image, rather than affecting the font itself.
Can anyone explain this?
Thanks!

Ok, nevermind - just realised it’s actually a <h1> element - this can be closed. Thanks!

On page 1/8, where two versions of the same website are linked (one version that’s supposed to be responsive, one that isn’t), both websites look and respond identically in my browser, no matter how much I play with the browser’s dimensions. Is that supposed to happen? I’m using Chrome 74.0.3729.108 (the latest version as far as I know) on OSX.

The first thing you should notice if starting at say 1000px width and shrinking down to around 600px is the title changes font size and position, and the ‘selected titles’ goes from the left to the center and heading background is screen-wide. Notice also how the background image of the header is smaller and looks centered again.
Shrink all the way down and watch the images change size.

Both links bring me to the same non responsive website in my browser too!

Yes you are right, I tried on my mac this exercise  and it didn’t work, both links were doing the same, but then I tried on an external screen and I could tell the difference.

They look identical but if you pay attention to the red banners that say “Selected Titles” and “Contact” you’ll see the small difference.

It’s not clear from the exercise where in the document the change should become apparent.
I think it’s only in the “Space Mono” at the bottom, because all other h2 content only has a single word.
Maybe change the exercise to alter more text so it’s more apparent what the attribute is affecting?

It would be very helpful to get some info on px, pt, em etc. and the difference between them. We had only very tangential info before on measurement units. I think it’s very important.

What is the value of 1 em and how it compares to 1 px? Could you only use px as a measure for spacing the elements in your website?

1px is an absolute value (as are mm, cm, in, pt) and is always 1 pixel.
1em is relative to the font size (roughly the height of the lowercase letters.)
The standard word spacing is 0.25em so it scales with changes in font size. You can use px instead but a 10px space is fine for large sizes but too wide for tiny sizes so you would have to adjust the spacing by hand again.
em is also useful for margin, padding, indentation and the like.

Thanks! This really helps.

There seems to be an error in the example given in this exercise:
h1 {
  word-spacing: 0.3em;
}

The explanation given is:

The default amount of space between words is usually 0.25em. In the example above, the word spacing is set to 0.3em, which represents an increase of only .05em in word spacing.

If this were true, then that would mean the word-spacing value (0.3em) represented the actual length of the space rendered between words. However, in the task, when we add the declaration word-spacing: 0.05em; to our h2 selector, the space rendered between the words Space and Mono does not reduce to a tiny 0.05em.
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/word-spacing explains that length values (e.g. 0.05em etc.) increase the existing default length of space by that value, rather than represent the actual length of space to be rendered.
This makes sense, as our declaration word-spacing: 0.05em; does appear to slightly increase the space between the words Space and Mono … (I assume from 0.25em to 0.3em).
Could someone confirm this, please?

Please more lesson on this word spacing

That totally makes sense thinking back to when I have used the similar property, letter-spacing in that past; I recall that I have provided it negative values to make a particular typeface more readable.
Just tested it and you can provide both word-spacing and letter-spacing with negative values, as well as positive ones.
So I think you’re right; the value provided is in addition to the existing spacing.

Thank you, this was really helpful 
The description in this lesson didn’t make sense to me either. And I couldn’t figure out WHAT exactly changed and WHERE after setting this declaration. So I started reading comments here and experimenting myself.
It seems true - any value>0 increases the spacing, while any value<0 decreases it.
The word/letter spacing settings work like this on various graphic design apps (ex. AI). So I believe it is a common practice 
But it would take me some time to figure this out without your comment 

To learn more about word-spacing, I would recommend this page: http://webtypography.net/2.1.1
It’s based on a classic typography textbook called The Elements of Typographic Style, and the website describes how this book can be applied to web typography with CSS.

What would the unit of measure for “em” be? Does it stand for a certain measurement?

https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_units.asp

Lol, I swear this lesson was made by some troll who wanted to see what they could get away with.  Change the word spacing of a tag that is one word? OMG, I so regret giving y’all money.

what is the default value for the kerning spacing??


You’ve learned how to increase the spacing between lines of text and words

The last lesson was word-spacing. Is line spacing something to do with padding and display: inline?

Ah, it seems to be later, in Line Height Anatomy. The sections must have been reordered at some point.

I have noticed that letter-spacing also gives the same amount of space after the last letter of the text. Is there an efficient way to stop this or compensate for it?

If you use it only on headings then it is not an issue since headings do not end with a full stop and typically have no punctuation. In paragraphs we should not mess with letter spacing.

so if the word-spacing's default value is .25 em (25% of the font-size) , what is the default em for letter-spacing ?

The default is normal, but what that equates to in ems is difficult to say. In 16px font size the spacing may be about 1px, so, 1/16 em, or 0.0625em.

thank you for making it clear!

What is the point of relative positions if we can achieve the same layout by setting a margin value? To further illustrate, say the following code in this exercise
.question {
  text-align: center;
  position: relative;
  top: 40px;
}

Doesn’t this do the exact same thing?
.question {
  text-align: center;
  margin-top: 40px;
}

What would the difference be and what can we use each one for?

This post explains it:




FAQ: CSS Display and Positioning - Position: Relative CSS FAQ


    lets do an example: 
https://jsbin.com/dukidawico/edit?html,css,output 
if you uncomment (ctrl + /) the css, you will see that both divs move down 
this is because margin is applied first, then the elements are “rendered”, causing both to move down. 
if we use move (again, uncomment the css line): 
https://jsbin.com/dokarohiye/edit?html,css,output 
the elements are “rendered” first, and then the #first element is pushed down, causing overlap, because the second element doesn’t move.
  



The object needs to move from some place, so how is the default value of the object’s position created? Like, the position value before you move the object.

if using position: static is the same as default why does the code for it even exist?




 cssslayer92451:

why does the code for it even exist?


Because in order for the default style sheet to have that property, it would have to exist in CSS.

Considering the example, does the transition-delay property delay for three seconds to transition back to it’s original position?




 byte4235076416:

transition-delay property


A transition does not spring back. It has one direction, only. For a spring back effect there will be two transitions. One to go from state A to state B, and one to go from state B to state A. Think in terms of the pseudo-class, :hover. One transition would take effect on mouse over, the spring back effect would happen on mouse out.

Thank you @mtf. I’ll have to read more on the pseudo-class :hover.

As it were I am only referring to CSS. We can manipulate the style sheet with DOM script, of which you may have already become aware. The focus here is literally CSS, with no scripting involved.

@mtf, not yet. I want to finish this path and learn about Javascript. When I get there I’ll refer back to this.

Indeed, read up on the pseudo-class. It is a crucial part of CSS. I am not a big fan of JS when CSS will suffice. CSS3 has pretty much made that clear. Why create a codespace where one already exists?

Pre-CSS3 we had JavaScript driven transitions. Those are no longer needed. The authors who gave us scripts up to that point are forever in our debt. Dave Shea woke me up JavaScript driven transitions, and I have little doubt he had a big hand in CSS3 because of his imaginative outlook. We should not lean on script where CSS will do the job.

  whoa! looks like it was a big deal back then. I heard it was the same for Flexbox. Positioning elements was a tedious task back then. So I was told.

http://www.tenfingers.net/
Drill into the script that supports the transitioning effect when you hover over the banner elements. This was from that ere, when CSS3 didn’t exist and all we had was CSS Level 2.

 i see something to do with mouse up, mouse down, mouse over, and mouse out. They all have individual scripts 

We’re only concerned with the mouse on and mouse off events. Ignore the rest of the page; it’s way out of date.
See how the images slowly come into focus as we move the mouse around?

Hi. If no margin is configured, what is the value of the margin that is established by default? In the exercise, you see the 3 red buttons at the end of the page with a separation between them when you do not have the margin set. Thanks in advance

In Instruction #2 it asked me to set the margin to 10px. I did so and I noticed no difference.
Did I miss something?

Do margins overlap? For example, the .share elements at the bottom of the page. When the margins are set to 10px, is there 10px between them or 20?

The solution is in one of the following lessons, Margin Collapse. The margins do not overlap, but are added together. So, the .share elements would be 20px apart, 10px from each box.

If we look at the gap between the buttons we see it is 20px, so that would suggest the margins add up (on the horizontal).

It’s not your fault, they said the class .share , but they meant .share a …

If I decrease the padding of the .share class to 0 px, 0 px still the horizontal borders are far apart from the red elements. Why the padding doesn’t shrink ? How can I shrink it ?

I am trying to make the content of my website ‘narrow’. I’m trying to accomplish that by giving the entire  a margin of 100px. Nested in the body i have my  which I set to width = 100%;
The result is the header ‘respects’ the margin in the right but not on the left side. Any idea why?
I have set the box-sizing: border-box; with the * selector.

BODY is not really meant to have margins, so might behave oddly in some devices when given them. Suggest create a page wrapper DIV inside the body and treat it with margins, or simply center it in the body.
 #wrapper {
    width: 95%
    margin: 0 auto;
}

You can give the body a background color or even a pattern background with tiling of a 32 X 32 (or 16 X 16) image.
I’m not a big fan of the universal selector since it is a resource hog. My solution is to specify exactly which elements will have all those above properties.

I tried the wrapper, it doesn’t seem to be working but I’m also not sure I did what you suggested exactly.

I actually have that bit in my separate reset.css file as recommended in one of the lessons. The border is just to help me understand where the different elements are positioned while I play around with them. The order three properties are recommended best practice in a Codecademy lesson I believe 

It seems I found the answer. As far as I understand my choice is to either have a navigation bar that is not fixed, fixed but not ‘narrow’ like the rest of the page or hard-coded to meet the same width as the body. However the last option will make it unresponsive, leading me to think the first option is the best,

I hope that link doesn’t break any rules, if it does I’m sorry.

For the sake of simplicity, I would shed anything that is not properly understood, whether recommended, or not. That includes the reset.css, and any properties you are not clear on, such as fixed position and z-index.
As mentioned earlier, margins and BODY are not good bedfellows. If anything, start by giving the body margin: 0, padding: 0, and border: none.
Just because we’ve seen something used in a lesson does not mean we have to use it, or that we even should. It complicates matters if we are are not clear on the box model, and cannot justify by our own reasoning and design consideration why something is implemented. It does not take a hammer and pry bar to construct a basic document. The simpler you keep it, the easier it is to see how fluidly HTML works.

 pywhiz00727:

doesn’t break any rules


With such a fluid markup language, it wouldn’t behoove it to have rules. The entire specification is built upon recommendations.
An HTML document is the scaffold of a user interface, or UX. The only logic is the author’s based upon considerations of usability. The first thing to wipe from the slate is any notion of rules. It’s a blank slate.
Recall how important it is that we are familiar with the default behavior of HTML elements. Which ones are blocks? Which ones are inline? Which ones have margins, or padding, or decoration, or bullets, or text-style, &c.?
We won’t learn that stuff trying to deconstruct a finished web page. It only adds to the mystery. If you want to tackle HTML, and master it, then kick aside the visual aspects and get into the structural aspects, especially where semantics and accessibility are concerned.

validator.w3.org

We can paste in chunks of HTML, or a complete page, and the validator will flag any markup that may be questionable or may contravene recommendations or guidelines. The latter, guidelines, is less so flagged, but there is some cautioning.
Validating against WAI-AAA levels is another concern, especially for web-facing pages. This is a whole 'nother world of HTML where we determine how accessible (therefore usable) our pages are to unsighted users with screen readers, or other developmentally challenged users who depend upon some form of assistive technology that has its roots in our very document.
Okay, so back to margins, and we should include padding in this discussion, as well. Margins have a negative effect on elements: the greater the margin, the narrower the element. Padding has a positive effect on elements: The greater the padding, the wider the element.
It’s this sort of information that we need to disseminate and play around with to get a complete handle on it. Boring, dull, banal, rudimentary, but… The core information we need to make HTML less of a wrestling match and more a directed approach to structuring a document.
Step back into this world and start working with basic documents, exploring one or two key elements in every way imaginable, without CSS.

Lists

unordered
ordered
definition
outline


Tables

for data
for layout


Forms

for information input
for user interaction


Block quotes
Semantic elements

document sectioning
content sectioning



In the earlier HTML snippet, HEADER and NAV are semantic sectioning elements. Their type describes their purpose. This goes a very long way to simplifying the code sample you posted earlier.
Consider the placement of the logo image in that sample. It uses a list item with an image and a link, which link is repeated in the next list item. The image size will undoubtedly be more than the font size. This will have a bearing later, when the CSS is brought into play.
Consider the earlier posted body, and how content can fall into one of the three contexts, header, main, and footer. We select them by type without the need to classify them.
So far we have four layers of document structure.
html
body
#wrapper
header main footer

There are very few style rules that will depend upon the high specificity of the wrapper, but it is there should a need ever arise. Add that to any selector and it will have a lot more sway. In the main, we would rather keep our selectors more generic with low specificity. It’s much less messy. We’ve digressed into CSS, so let’s not go too far.
I’m off to edit the earlier post, to give us something to lead off with in your exploration.

Thanks again for a thorough explanation.
I think you misunderstood my question of whether the link i posted was against the rules. I linked to an answer I found to the issue on another website but I’m not sure if doing so is in accordance with the form rules here.
I do believe most of the concepts you mention. I am/was having some difficulties with fixed position but I think I get it now: fixed position elements are taken out of the html flow, which mean other elements ‘ignore’ them. And therefore it’s child element are de facto children of the fixed position element’s parent - is this correct?
Studying the MDN web docs is a great help too, thanks.

Yes, that is correct. Fixed and absolutely positioned elements are out of normal flow.

Why margins does not work with th or td elements?

Are the margin-top and margin-bottom the same as the Google Doc/Microsoft Word functions of “Add space to the top/bottom of paragraph?” Is this the code that happens whenever I do that on a doc?

262,Can the text align-property only be used to align text or can we use it to align other content as well?,"FAQ,CSS FAQ",,12,"
Question
Can the text align-property only be used to align text or can we use it to align other content as well?
Answer
The text-align property is used to align the inner content of a block element. This means that in addition to aligning text, it can also be used to align inline or inline-block elements within a containing div.
You will learn more about inline, inline-block, and block level elements in the next exercise.
","
text-align: justify; what this command does?

for that we have documentation:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-align
it gives both an explanation and an example you can play with, the combination of this should make it clear? Learning to read and understand documentation is a very good skill to have as programmer

in the asignments for this topic it is written the following below:
he  text-align  property can be set to one of the following three values:


left  — aligns text to the left hand side of its parent element, which in this case is the browser.

i wonder how can a browser be considered a parent? i mean a browser is not html-element right

A browser (like Firefox and chrome) have a default stylesheet, which align the text to the left and other things.

yes but when i think of it i view it as for instance let’s say:
we have an (div) bla bla (/div)  (couldn’t type in divtags it actually worked so i left out the <)element or whatever as the  parent element, wouldn’t that mean that the text will be to the left of whatever is contained in the div?
whilst in case of a browser how does the text be aigned to the left of the browser since the text is to appear on the browser?




 illpro1:

whilst in case of a browser how does the text be aigned to the left of the browser since the text is to appear on the browser?


the browser is perfectly capable of setting some defaults (like aligning text to the left), very likely done through css.
Given that the browser has to render everything, surely its capable of doing something under the hood.

i think you misunderstood my question, since the instructions said that the browser will align the text to the left of the browser! i mean that seems impossible because the text of any webpage is shown in a web-browser such as mozilla firefox, google chrome , internet explorer & safari etc. if we for example have  symbolise the browser with these to signs |  browser symbole | then to align text to the left of the browser would be something like this: “text that is left of the browser” |  browser symbole |
if text was left of the browser it would be in some other program or desktop that is not the browser or are they trying to say that the text is to be scrolled so that if the browser is rendered at some point the other text will be achieved by scrolling to the left?

The lesson url that is in the FAQ seems broken, do you have the correct one for me?



 illpro1:

i think you misunderstood my question, since the instructions said that the browser will align the text to the left of the browser!


So your point is, that the text should say: left-hand side of the browser?  Actually, that isn’t even accurate. Its the left hand side of the element the text is in

Is there a reason why elements other than text can be aligned only when contained in a div? Or am I reading the explanation wrong?

text-align is one of many css properties. We can position pretty much every element in many ways

Hi illpro1, I think you may have misread or misunderstood the text of explanation in the lesson. I am talking about this part
The text-align property can be set to one of the following three values:  left — aligns text to the left hand side of its parent element, which in this case is the browser. Ok. This is not saying to the left of the browser window or the HTML page itself. If no ‘text-align’ rule is put in a .css file then by default the browser will align things to the left side of the browser window or view screen or however you like to think about viewing/looking at a web-page. You can prove this to yourself by making a simple HTML file using the <h>A Test</h>then displaying it your browser of choice. It’s when you as the writer or author or maker of the web-page would like to have some header or paragraph or some other kind of element to appear lined up on the page somewhere else other than the left side is when you use the a text-align to place where you or your customer/client/friend wants it. I really hope this helps clear up the purpose of the text-align property as it is used in CSS files. Oh, and by the way I fully understand what you mean when you say how can the browser be considered the parent. To my mind the browser program isn’t  the ‘parent’ in a relational sense to any web-page/web-site. It is the program that displays the contents of the web-page/web-site. The only way I can wrap my mind around it as a ‘parent’ is to think in terms of containers(think of a boxes within boxes) and in this case the browser is kind of like the parent container and the operating system(windows,linux,etc.) is the parent of the browser program and the hardware(motherboard,memory, etc) is the parent of the operating system.

I don’t fully understand how the breadcrumbs chevrons were formed. How come by just playing with border size and transparency you created what is essentially triangles?

I agree. I’m currently in the middle of this exercise, and although I’ve fiddled around with devtools to experiment with the chevrons a bit, some further explanation as to how they are formed into arrows would be much appreciated!

If it doesn’t add up to twelve, it will assume the next element as the completion to make up twelve columns.

they are essentially divs with fancy names. They are defined that way under the HTML 5 specs to add more semantic meaning to our content.
Earlier we used to write those elements as <div class=“section”>  <div class=“figure”>  and so on. We can still use it like that but using semantic names gives more meaning to your html code.

How come the heading h1 is already in the center before we align text? What is the piece of code that enables that?




 lauracaroline:

What is the piece of code that enables that?


It’s known as the user agent style sheet, the base default styles built into the browser. These styles are necessary to give core elements basic style properties. Headings have defined size, alignment and margins; lists have defined padding and bullets; paragraphs have defined margins; and so on.
As specificity goes, the default styles have the least amount of importance so are easy to override.

Does the .banner have something to do with it? It has text-align: center and when I remove that the h1 defaults to the left. However, that doesn’t make sense as a .class selector should be more specific than an element selector.

How do you code justified text using CSS/HTML?

p {
  text-align: justify;
}


Ah, its that easy 
Thanks!




 mtf:

I don’t think there’s any user agent style sheet that has the text-align: center; for h1.

.banner is the parent of h1, so h1 will take the the alignment defined in .banner, unless you are more specific and define it in h1. Try giving h1 text-align: left; and you will see, it will override the .banner. However you can be more specific and define .banner h1, that will override both banner and h1 alignments.

In the index.html file at the very end of the code there are 2 red notification regarding </DOCTYPE!>

Its must be in lowercase
Its must be paired, no start tag

Yet when reviewing the codes of my earlier lessons on HTML I notice neither have been the case.
The DOCTYPE is always written in capitals and there is actually never a closing tag at the end.
So what going on in  this particular code and what is the correct solution to fixing the code ? 

where it says:
On line 6 of  index.html , copy and paste the code below to apply the CSS file to the existing HTML.
I’ve tried pasting: 
on line 6 before and after"" .header{""
No luck.  I hit solution and the page changes on the right but the text editor doesn’t at all on line 6
And consistently ""Get Help/Solution/Get Code Solution doesn’t return anything other than the original unsolved page.  I’ve tried to just keep moving on but not sure why this doesn’t work.

Hi Aurlander,
 I am having the same experience...was there ever a solution?

The code to copy and paste is,
<link rel=""stylesheet"" href=""style.css"">

It should be pasted into the HTML document, not the stylesheet. Switch tabs to index.html and paste that on line 6, then Run.

As a complete aside, relating to the earlier question with respect to DOCTYPE, first, it is not an HTML tag, but an SGML tag, being as it is not written inside the <html></html> element. Second, it is not case sensitive so may be written in either lower or upper case.
<!doctype html>
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<!DOCTYPE html>
<!doctype HTML>

The third one in the list is most typical, but all four are valid and work exactly the same.

Hi Roy,
Thanks very much for taking the time to reply…very useful information. Mike Logan

Why does the class. “share” height change when I type in the #main ID a height of 1000px?

Not clear on your question. .share is independent of #main so should see no effect. Can you illustrate your question with a before and after screen grab?


image.png615×802 34.6 KB

I believe the above poster is asking why when there is no overflow property declared on #main, and the height is set to 1000px, that the position of .share changes to the center of our #main div. I too was wondering why this seems to so drastically change the placement of our .share div.

That is a positioning problem we should be able to sort out once we see your style sheet. Please post style.css.
Belay, belay. I have reproduced your example and will need to ponder awhile the reason why we see this behavior.

Here’s one thought… Because the height is set to 1000px on #main, and both it and .share have position: relative; properties, the latter is positioning itself 1000px down from the banner.
Recall that HTML is greedy when it comes to page length. The DIV will stretch to whatever length it needs to accomodate the content. However once we introduce height we exceed this paradigm by imposing artificial limits. Strange behavior should be expected, which we witness here. Take the height property away from #main and the behavior will be natural.
Bottom line, we should always impose an overflow rule if we expect the content to exceed our prescribed height.

I tried to play about with this too, I tried to change the positioning of the elements to try and overcome the issue to no avail. The only rule set that moved to element was position: fixed; which moved the element out of sight, essentially hidden. Is this down to the same issue (The unexpected results of html trying to compensate for the overspill?

We should not have to change the position property for this demo to work. Simply impose a height that is less than what is needed to contain all the content in #main, and add an overflow:scroll property. Save and examine the output.

Sorry i think you misunderstood my question. I had already completed the lesson and succeeded. I just wanted to see if I could get the element to stay at the bottom of the page… I’ve learnt a bit more about CSS now and understand that “fixed: position;” is fixed relative to the viewport  and the values one sets. At the time i misunderstood what position: fixed; rule actually did. I was going on the assumption that it fixed it in the position where it was placed in the code…

Had I tried to explain what you discovered, would it have been as effective? I didn’t misunderstand your question, but evaded it. Now of your own volition you have a better understanding of position. No doubt static came into that.
When we wish to fix something relative to a parent container that is not the body, then that container must be position: relative. A position: absolute property on a child of that container will adhere to the parent top and left boundaries.
Fixing relates to the browser viewport, not just the element viewport. It has plenty of uses, though a design will naturally work around the constraints of a fixed element. We can fix elements to the left and right side, as well, not just top and bottom.

Hi @mtf, would you kindly explain why the component with .share class overlaps the one with #main id when I set its height to 1000px even though the I have set the margin of .share to 10px?

In this exercise it says that the overflow property is set on a parent element. I understand why and when that would be.
However, when the parent element contains multiple children, and say we only want the overflow to affect the content of one particular child, can we set the overflow directly on this child element?
e.g.
<div id=""main"">
  <h2>Title</h2>
  <p>Paragraph 1</p>
  <p>Paragraph 2</p>
  <h3>Quote</h3>
  <p>Paragraph 3</p>
  <p>Paragraph 4</p>
</div>

#main {
  padding: 20px;
  margin: 30px;
  max-width: 700px;
  max-height: 2000px;
  overflow: scroll;
}

h2{
  text-align: center;
}

h3 {
  border: 1px solid;
  padding: 10px 20px;
  margin: 0 10%;
  text-align: center;
  max-height: 200px;
  overflow: hidden;
}

p {
  text-align: justify;
}

As you can see from the CSS, there is a scroll bar to tackle the overflow from ALL of the child elements (title, paragraphs and quote combined).
The declaration overflow: hidden; with an h3 selector hides any part of the quote which would spill outside of its border when the screen size is narrowed. This code works, but would it be better practice to create an additional parent element around the h3 and set the overflow on this instead?
e.g.
(NB: full code from above applies, but with the following amendments)
  <p>Paragraph 2</p>
  <div class=""quote"">
    <h3>Quote</h3>
  </div>
  <p>Paragraph 3</p>

.quote h3 {
  max-height: 250px;
  overflow: hidden;
}

h3 {
  border: 1px solid;
  padding: 10px 20px;
  margin: 0 10%;
  text-align: center;
}




 jon_morris:

can we set the overflow directly on this child element?


We can set overflow on any element that we wish to preserve size and or shape of the visible region within it. There is no set rule that it can only apply to a parent. Every case may be different. In an adaptive or responsive page, elements may be changing size according to media queries, which rulesets may also contain their own overflow properties.

With the variety of display resolutions on various devices, in what situation would it be worth NOT using overflow?




 erichung5755275764:

Hi @mtf, would you kindly explain why the component with .share class overlaps the one with #main id when I set its height to 1000px even though the I have set the margin of .share to 10px?


Because you have limited the height of #main to 1000px, which is insufficient to contain all of the p element text, resulting in the p text overflowing into the .share section.
You can fix this problem two ways (at least!)


Remove the height restriction of 1000px on #main, allowing the p text to take up as much vertical space as it needs.


Add the overflow: scroll; declaration in #main, preventing the nasty overflow from occurring, and replacing it with a vertical area that you can scroll through, but which still only occupies 1000px of height on the page.



How is the size of the image 364 pixels wide and 244 pixels tall measured from adding all the vertical dimensions together and adding all the horizontal dimensions together, yet in the example about overflow the dimensions given don’t add to either number?
overflow.png933×808 63.1 KB


Not sure if I’m understanding your question correctly but the total width is broken down like this:
40 (20 for left margin and 20 for right margin)
4 (2 for left border and 2 for right border)
20 (10 for left padding and 10 for right padding)
300 (width of the image or content itself)
Total: 364
The same can be applied to the height:
20 for all margins
4 for all borders
20 for all padding
200 for content
Total: 244
Hope that helps!

how can i set one side overflow only?
e.g horizontal side

How come everything slide OVER the navbar at the end of the exercise?
I was expecting everything to slide UNDER, as with the gif. But it didn’t…
Googling so far hasn’t given any ideas. Please help.

To fix this, just give the header a z-index value greater than 1. That will make a higher layer than the  other content.

Thanks, mtf.
The z-index was the next item on the classes list 

Why does the header’s list items completely cover H1 and P, I’m  confused why they aren’t automatically below the fixed header since these elements are already below the header in the HTML document. Also does the header appear to be at the very top of the page because this element is a child of the body and the body has no content yet so its pushed to the top of the document. Thank you !

A fixed element is out of normal flow so the elements that follow start at top left. Determine the height of the header and put a top margin on the next element to compensate for the hidden space beneath the header.

Why the rest of the page becomes messy?

Why does changing the position of .welcome to relative move it in front of the header in step 2?

Why does the .welcome cover the header? the header using fixed position was displayed on top of the other elements but why not for the welcome message? is there some sort of priority for display when it comes to relative vs fixed vs absolute positioning?

After completing Step 1 of this exercise (changing the position inside of the  header rule from absolute to fixed), it says “Notice that part of the “Welcome” section is now covered up by the header.” But it seemed to me that the “Welcome” section was already covered by the header when the header was set to absolute. Am I wrong in thinking nothing changed in that regard?

That may well be the case since absolute and fixed are both out of normal flow so content can slip under them in both cases. Don’t let the lesson narrative throw you off.

Why does the .welcome cover the header? the header using fixed position was displayed on top of the other elements but why not for the welcome message? is there some sort of priority for display when it comes to relative vs fixed vs absolute positioning?

In this exercise, setting the position of the header element to fixed takes it out of the normal html flow. This causes a complication in that the rest of the page ignores its presence. As a result, when the page is first rendered, before you even scroll, part of the page is obscured underneath the header.
The solution in the exercise is to introduce a relative offset to the next element on the page.  That brings the next element out from underneath the header, but now we have overlap with element after that. Wouldn’t it be easier to put some white space at the top of the page so that all the elements except for the header are just shifted down. That seems simpler and less error prone to me that individually offsetting every element on the page.
Am I missing something?

I have the same question as others in this thread. I understand that giving the header element a fixed position causes it to “stick” to the top of the screen and other elements are now ignoring it and flowing underneath. However when the .welcome element is given a relative position, why does it suddenly jump forward in front of the header?
The next section of the lesson discussing z-indexes, but only in terms of manually changing it using an integer value. There’s no mention of relative positioning coming with a default higher integer than fixed positioning.
Does this have something to do with the fact that fixed positioning seems to have an overlay effect, rather than fully covering the content beneath?

Does “relative”  and “absolute”  and “fixed” property ignore flow of the element or html documents?
This is very confusing.




 ronny73:

“absolute” and “fixed”


Those two properties take their element out of normal flow.



 ronny73:

“relative”


That property lets its element stay in normal flow.

It seems like absolute and fixed only really make sense when they are applied to the HTML element located at the start of the flow. What if, for example, we had set the position of a box in between the first and third elements in the flow to absolute and offset its position? Which element would it offset itself relative to?

Is there any reason why header element is transparent? I cannot find property in stylesheet that caused this effect.

It’s not transparent in my workspace, but adding an opacity property changes that. Check the selector rule for header and see if that property exists. You can play with it or remove it. I set it to 75% and it looks okay.

When we set the position of the .welcome, why header element could not cover the element with the class welcome?

When we set background’s opacity (alpha) to lower values, it becomes lighter in our case.
Hence it implies that background of the farthest (in terms of z-index) background is white.
Is it always so? Is there a way to change this behaviour?




 matrenitski:

When we set background’s opacity (alpha) to lower values, it becomes lighter in our case.


yes, but i wouldn’t use lighter as term in this content. I would use more transparent.
0 is complete transparent, while 1 is completely solid. That is the way it is, nothing you can change about it.
transparency is not related to z-index.

Your point stands, but I think I understand what matrenitski is saying.
Since we can change background’s alpha, there’s an implication that there is another unalterable or absolute  background on say z-index: -infinity, and that background is inherently set as pure white.
Because of that, if we lower the alpha of our lowest z-index element, white is being introduced into the color mix.
I believe the reality of the question is that we’re building a website on a canvas, and that canvas is white, so no matter what you do on top, the canvas will always be at the bottom.
There is a similar idea in video but in that case, the canvas is black.
Hope that makes sense.

for some reason setting alpha works even without changing hsl to hsla. Any idea why?

adding a 4th argument will automatically use hsla i assume. At least, that seems logic

Corrigendum

Alpha can only be used with HSL and RGB colors; we cannot add the alpha value to color: green color: #FFFFF

Alpha is added to hex code colours by addition of a seventh and eight digit to represent the percentage of alpha transparence. IE #7e7e7e80, equivelant to grey at 50% alpha transparence.

I suppose you could make a ‘mybackground’ element that is any color you choose for the base color of the ‘canvas’ then put ‘background’ colors on top of that so that as you increase transparency of any given background element it would approach the color you chose for your ‘mybackground’

grid-template: repeat(4, 1fr 2fr) / repeat(4, 3fr 2fr);
This above is the code used in the exercise for the parent element. the question demanded you apportion a child item to occupy the fifth and sixth rows. but from the code above the parent grid has only four rows.




 chukwubuikemezeoke12:

the parent grid has only four rows.


From this we can conclude that the grid has 8 rows…
  <div class=""grid"">
    <div class=""box a"">A</div>
    <div class=""box b"">B</div>
  </div>

.a {
  grid-row-start: 5;

.b {

  grid-row-end: 9;
}


eight_row_grid.PNG515×518 1.56 KB


I‎ just got it. I forgot that repeat(4, 1fr 2fr) means duplicate

Why do we use two separate classes
.box and .a 

instead of just
 .box a




 medozhasa:

.box a


With no class denotation (the dot) the a is seen as an element type, meaning it would look like this in the HTML…
<div class=""box"">
    <a href=""#"">link text</a>

With the dot it is a combinator where both classes must match.
<div class""box a"">

This helped. Thank you.

Does anyone understand what having negative grid-row-start/end does? The link didn’t really help me.

From my understanding, negative integers basically start counting from the END of the grid. So grid-row-start: -1; would select the last grid line in the grid as the starting point. I suppose this might be useful if you don’t know exactly how many rows you have.
Can someone more knowledgeable correct me if I’m wrong.




 chukwubuikemezeoke12:

I forgot that repeat(4, 1fr 2fr) means duplicate


Hi guys,
sorry but I have a question.
I have understood that the first value in repeat, defines the number of rows or columns in a grid. The next 2 values define the size of those rows or columns.
I did not read that  the first value duplicates something.
When we write repeat(3, 100px) we mean 3 rows or columns of 100px, not 6…
Morover, if this code means duplicate --> repeat(4, 1fr 2fr) <-- which size should have row or columns?
I am confused




 rodolfovienna:

repeat(4, 1fr 2fr)


The spread is akin to four columns/rows, each containing two columns/rows, the first is half the size of the second.
 1fr    2fr
 ---- -------- ---- -------- ---- -------- ---- --------
|    |        |    |        |    |        |    |        |

I was confused by this too, reread activity 7, particularly the bottom bit.

2. The container has three grid items that do not have a specified width.
3. Without setting the  align-items  property, these elements will span the height of the row they are in (400 pixels).
""
This section of Align Items is a direct copy of theJustify Items exercise, but should’nt the word width in 2. have been replace with height as we are now talking about block level alignment and rows?

I think it’s correct. If it said ‘height’ in #2, then it would become a false statement, as it does specify the height in #1 (400px).

I think tysker86 is right. The grid-template-rows property specifies the height of each grid row, but not the height of each item. These two heights are different. That’s why the align-items property can make a difference by setting where to vertically locate an item inside the grid row.

In this lesson, setting the value of “align-items” to “stretch” gives us the same result as not using the property at all. Since the default behaviour of items is to take up the whole row, when would we use “align-items: stretch;”?

I tried to enter the lesson’s example code into a test page to visualize everything for myself but the property “rows” wasn’t recognized.

what is the difference between “justify-content” and ""justify-item "" commands?

I set the width for .recipe to 200px, then I used the (justify-item:end) for .main but there wasn’t any change for the main?




 haroonsateerrahimi:

used the (justify-item:end) for .main but there wasn’t any change for the main?


Add an ‘s’ to the end of ‘item’: justify-items: end;

the difference is barely justify-items: end; vs visible justify-items: center;
check out the image
justify.png1274×1324 537 KB


I hope that I’m understanding this correctly in which I am not giving out misinformation.
First off, the class .recipe has a width of 200px.  The grid-template-columns have width 250px.  So “justify-item” shifts the “.recipe” left and right within the 250px columns.
Next, “justify-content” moves the entire column across the page along the row axis.  It moves the entire 250px box instead of just the item within the column.

Is worthwhile to study Flexbox and Pseudo classes, elements, selector CSS?
They are not obsolete? If not what are some benefits?

I’m still learning myself and although Flexbox and Grids are similar they do have their differences. It’s worth learning them all as you may need a slightly different tool as a solution to a problem…

A piece of advice for other learners:
This CSS Grid module made about a thousand times more sense after I completed the CSS Flexbox lesson that’s in the Web Development course.
While Grid and Flexbox are two different skillsets, they share some terminology and basically the same hierarchical concepts.

Also I found a great YouTube channel called Layout Land, which breaks everything down amazingly! It really helped to digest it all with helpful video content and visuals.

Why did we give the implicit grid-auto-rows property a greater height (500px) than the explicit grid-template-rows (450px)?

I guess it’s just for the sake of learning how grid-auto-rows can set a different height than the height specified by grid-template-rows. Aesthetically, however, I agree with you. We shouldn’t give a different height.

I still cannot understand why we need to Delete the  height: 1600px;  declaration from the  main  rule-set in  style.css .?? Could someone please explain ? Thank you !

Hello!  For some reason my brain couldn’t understand the concept from this chapter, but trying to find a source that could explain it to me I found this: https://css-tricks.com/difference-explicit-implicit-grids/
It clearly explained to me the reasoning of these properties with clear visuals and code examples to explain how and why they are used. I’m sorry Codeacademy! Your example here wasn’t straightforward enough for me!
These threads have helped me a lot along the way so I thought I would share something that helped me here.

I think since we added that 3rd row, the height of all the content now exceeds 1600px; you’ll notice the bottom two recipes get cut off, so deleting the height property stop the footer from covering anything.

I can live with the fact that horizontal margin adds-up while vertical margins don’t… but why is that? I’m just curious what’s the reason behind it.

While I definitely don’t know for sure, my guess it has something to do with how we consume web pages.
We’re accustomed to vertical scrolling  and reading content from top to bottom to an endless degree while horizontal scrolling isn’t really user-friendly.
Rather than focusing on why vertical margins are collapsible, I’m thinking horizontal is not collapsible so that it’s easier to create a static width across all your content.
So, for example if a version of the web page is designed to be 1000px wide, you know that all of your horizontal measurements need to add up to 1000px across the board. Since they’re not collapsible horizontally, you don’t have to worry about bigger margins eating smaller margins and making the math confusing.
At least that’s what I got out of it. Would love to be corrected or explained more properly!

Are there many other people confused like me about whether the top/bottom margins are horizontal or vertical, and vice versa for the left/right margins?
My inital thought was that the lesson is wrong in calling the top/bottom margins vertical, because I see these margins as running horizontally across the page, and the left/right margins as running up/down the page vertically…
I was so sure I was right, that I’ve sent an error report. HOWEVER, having just read this exercise about Margin Collapse, I can see that it clearly calls the collapsing margins vertical. Surely, it can’t be wrong throughout the lesson… 
Anyway, I checked Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margin_(typography), and saw that top/bottom margins are measured vertically (even though they run horizontally) and vice versa for left/right margins!.. 
So, I was feeling guilty (and pretty sheepish) about my error report submission  , when I then looked closely at the FAQ post for this exercise called… wait for it…  What is the reason behind collapsing on horizontal margins and not vertical…  …spot where I’m going with this? 
@axelkaban, are you confirming that my inital feeling was right (and the lesson misleading)? Or, are you just as confused as I am? 
Having written this, I’m now most definitely feeling like a collapsed margin myself!.. I’m not sure whether I’m vertical or horizontal… but definitely collapsed!  

Lol, that is a good point, I wrote the question in terms of confusion, but as you point out it turns to be even more confusing. I tried to deviate and clear it up by using only the terms top and bottom as well as left and right when explaining the relation of the margins, but it is fair to say that I should start with the disclaimer that left and right margins will always pertain to the horizontal (which do not collapse) and the top and bottom margins belonging to the vertical term. Why is it that they are assigned that way, mainly because if we think in grid terms (since all elements are actually set as boxes) left and right margins will be placed one next to the other on a row:
____      ______      _______
----|R| L|------|R||L|-------| etc.
----      ------      -------
     ^ ^         ^  ^
<----|-|---------|--|--------->Horizontal margin

Yet, our top and bottom margins are stacked up one on top of the other in columns:
 ---------  ----------
|         ||          |
 ---------  ----------                       ^
  bottom  |   bottom <----- vertical margin  |
 ---------------------                       | 
    top   |    top   <------ vertical margin |
 ---------  ----------                       v
|         ||          |

Thus, we have top and bottom margins as vertical and left and right as horizontal.
Sorry if I got you more confused before. Thank you for pointing it out!

Thanks for the clarification! Much appreciated, and I’m no longer confused! 
Unless I’m the only person who’s taken a while before the penny’s dropped on this concept, maybe an addition to the lesson material somewhere might help avoid any confusion i.e. explicitly stating that top/bottom margins = vertical margins, and left/right margins = horizontal margins, with a quick explanation of the logic for this.
By the way, what helped me to best rationalise the logic for this classification is the following:
Top/bottom margins expand or contract along a vertical axis (even though visually they run horizontally along the page).
Left/right margins expand or contract along a horizontal axis (even though visually they run vertically up/down the page).
I’ve included that in case it helps anyone else too 

After the naming conventions fried my brain the provided analogy in this lesson about short/tall people didn’t help me very much. Based on the diagram, I ended up thinking of it in terms of gravity; elements on top of each other are stacked and therefore their margins collapse but elements side by side aren’t forced together so their margins don’t. Hopefully someone finds that useful!

in reference to this image, how far away will the vertical margin be from element C? ie, at what point is the border between the two elements?

There are multiple ways to do this exercise I’m sure. What are some possible ways to go about it? I don’t entirely grasp how the various positioning attributes interact with each other. I think being able to see a few examples would help me understand them better. I finished this exercise but I feel like it ‘just kind of worked’, but that it wasn’t the right way.

Hi, I left the first circle (blue) as it was and thought it would be optimal to overlap the two so I changed the CSS for the second circle (red) to:
#blue {
  background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.5);
  position: absolute;
  top: 100px;
}

If you compare the HTML to CSS it’s a bit confusing as the stylesheet is written red/blue but the document is written blue/red!
Anyways, in watercolour we call these things ‘happy accidents’ and I feel the same as I go through the series on CodeAcademy - no testing framework can account for all eventualities but when learning I accept these inconsistencies as it reflects real-world situations and often makes me think more deeply about how to solve the challenge in hand.

Hi guys,
for this exercise I used this code and that works, I hope it can be helpful:
.circle {
border-radius: 50%;
width: 200px;
height: 200px;
}
#red {
background-color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 0.5);

}

background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.5);
position: absolute;
top: 10px;
}

The blue circle  was created first in the HTML document. So, why is the red circle displayed first in the user interface?

The style sheet has a mistake in it. They’ve given #blue the red color, and #red the blue color. Switch the colors, or swap the selectors.

Ok, I used
#blue {
background-color: rgb(0, 0, 255);
position: absolute;
top: 100px;
}
I got them to overlap. I fully grasp why this works the way it did. Afterwards I was just playing around and moved the circle to the right with:
#blue {
background-color: rgb(0, 0, 255);
position: absolute;
top: 100px;
left:100px;
}
It did what I expected it too moved it to the side 100px.
Here is where my confusion comes in, I then changed it to “relative”
#blue {
background-color: rgb(0, 0, 255);
position: relative;
top: 100px;
left:100px;
}
and the red circle moved down the page, blue stayed in the same place…why does the red circle move when I set the blue circles position as relative?




 gregbutler1016:

why does the red circle move when I set the blue circles position as relative?


Because it is in normal flow and as a block level element takes the next available position, which is below the preceding div.

  What can I do to pass this one?

What position value would we use on line 17? Here are your choices…
static
fixed
relative
absolute

Give the last one a try and see what happens.

thanks! what a quick response. I did try that already. My problem was that I didn’t understand from the question that codecademy expected the circles to FULLY overlap. I liked them half overlapped, so that they could be seen in their original and mixed states. I cheated to get the “answer” and continue.

Yeah, the word ‘overlap’ is a bit misleading. ‘overlay’, or ‘conceal’ might be more to the point.

I didn’t realise they expected the circles on top of each other so I used position: relative and then moved each respectively with bottom: px and top: px

Why is “type” with type=“text/css” not necessary in linking fonts?

Why do we need 2 link rel=“stylesheet” type=“text/css” href=“styles/style.css” ?

I wasn’t sure where the link came from? i did copy the video but it didn’t give me a link, i could only download the font.

When you see the fonts listed, click the (+) button on the top right of the font you want. A pop-up appears in the bottom of your screen that says “1 family selected”. Under the “EMBED” section you can choose the link that is “Standard” or you can choose an “@IMPORT” link. This description follows the latest chrome browser. Using a different browser may be slightly different. Try using chrome if you are having troubles with following these instructions (Chrome is designed by google so fonts.google should work easily).

Why is “type” with type=“text/css” not necessary in linking fonts?


I also wasn’t sure about this, and in the examples given in this exercise, the first two include the type=""text/css"" attribute, whereas the third one doesn’t. So, I decided to investigate…
According to https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/link, when the linked document is a stylesheet (i.e. rel=""stylesheet""), the type attribute can be omitted (and this is recommended), because apparently CSS is the only type of stylesheet language available on the web anyway.
This seems to imply that we can omit type=""text/css"" whenever we link to a stylesheet, not just when linking externally to fonts.
Could someone with more experience confirm this?

I remember seeing the answer to this in an earlier exercise’s forum discussion - I found it. The answer is that the type attribute can be omitted since html5.
Link to the post:
https://discuss.codecademy.com/t/faq-learn-css-selectors-visual-rules-css-setup-selectors-linking-the-css-file/267369/15?u=agentgenx

Please update the exercise. Step one doesn’t accept the link from fonts.google which now is:  (""&display=swap"" has been added)

I agree with Natalie.  The link for the google font is now different.

Definitely needs updating.

Agreed! Had me confused.

where does the .space .sample . text tag come from??

I third this. Has Codecademy abandoned these lessons?




 rhea0866gmail.com:

where does the .space .sample . text tag come from??


Those are CSS classes; they are defined in the HTML.

The link I used which was provided from the website: ( fonts.google.com ) did not work.
This was my link:
I checked the hint (which gave a link): <link href=""https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Space+Mono:400,700 rel=“stylesheet”>
The difference:
“&display=swap”
is the only exclusion, is this a bug? Maybe the link changed?

Agree. The answer to this exercise seems to be out of date. And since it relies on an outside website as a source, the directions will give you an incorrect answer.

Correct, there is an issue with the current lesson, concerning “&display=swap”
This is a fantastic feature that we should all be excited for, but the lesson definitely needs to be updated to accept multiple responses, and potentially even add a quick lesson teaching what exactly display=swap does.
Read more about display=swap

bump on that update.

Still broken because of “&display=swap”
Report sent via Get Help > Bugs form, I encourage everyone to do the same (since these forums don’t seem to be monitored by Codecademy devs).

Still broken. BUT, I tried taking out  &display=swap, then ran it again. It works! This may not be the perfect solution, but it might get you past this step.

A post was split to a new topic: Can we use { opacity: 0 } instead of visibility?

Is using
*{
margin: 0;
padding: 0;
}
the best way to do this?
I ran this by a friend who works as a front end dev and he suggested using this instead:
Html, body{
margin: 0;
padding: 0;
)
What are some thoughts on this? Are there trade-offs to using one method over the other? Does it essentially do the same thing?

Universal selector use comes with a cost. How many HTMLElements are there? Every one of them will be given this rule. This becomes even more expensive in a page that has any CSS or DOM interaction since the page has to be redrawn with every interaction. Sure it’s cool, and looks like a magic pill to apply an instant global solution, but remember the cost. This selector is never cheap.
Write resets on elements that are actually in the document, and forgo the instant solution approach. It will be much less costly in terms of resource use and performance.

Why is the Conservation Efforts at Lake Tahoe Being Praised by Nation’s Leaders seem like its the only thing affected by the resetting default? as in why is it the only one which got shifted to the left?
        
I don’t see a difference.

All the more reason to NOT use reset.css. Until one knows what is being reset, it makes absolutely no sense to apply such a blanket ruleset.
Learn the basic behavior of the browser before you begin to blindly override it. Don’t use reset.css. You’ll never learn what really needs to be learned about the fundamental behaviors of a browser. First, learn the default style sheet, then tinker with it.
It doesn’t hurt to learn that some browsers create a margin by default. On learning that we can,
html, body {
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
}

Problem solved. Now all the browsers start out with a blank slate in terms of positioning of the root document.
We can also match font size to what the user has set in their User Style Sheet by,
html, body {
    font-size: 100%;
}

If our document uses relative sized fonts throughout, we’ll always be in the visual range chosen by the user.
Then there is color. Some users have default color schemes that could completely break our presentation.
html, body {
    color: black;
    background-color: white;
}

These are all legitimate ways to reset. They do not waste resources. They are easy to follow on each redraw of the page.
Note that interactions do not take place on a particular segment of the page. The entire page has to be redrawn. That means parsing the style sheet all over, each time.
Bottom line, don’t use reset.css. Turn off CSS and study every element in the specification, one by one and learn how they each behave in the browser. Get to know the User Agent Style Sheet before brushing it aside with a style sheet you do not understand.

I reset the default margins and padding, but I did not notice any changes in the website. Am I just not noticing it? What am I supposed to see?

For me its the same. What was supposed to change?

I don’t see any change? What am I supposed to see?
Asking this again since no one resolved this.

Also not seeing any changes after adding the 0 values. Also curious as to why things are offset in the first place compared to where they were in the previous lesson. What changed in the code to accomplish this?

Personally all of my content was more streamlined, the border text & border over the image was moved to the left, the paragraph content was more streamlined and the buttons at the bottom of the page shifted position too

from what I was able to see (I’m using up to date chrome in may 2020), the only thing I noticed is that there was a slight white margin around the banner. resetting it meant that the banner stretched to the whole page.
It is frustrating that the code we fix in previous steps gets “unfixed” but after a point, I got tired of refixing it.
if you are getting frustrated with this, you can do what I do and keep a VS code window open to the side and copy paste all the code for the exercise into it.
whenever I fix something in vs code, I paste it back over. or instead you could copy it from codeacademy over to vs code before you go to the next page and keep the changes you made.
i also do this for the projects because the lack of auto completes can wear down on me if I have to call a function that was written to be 20 characters or something 8 times,
console.log(thisFunctionNameShouldHaveBeenShortened(x,y,z));
console.log(thisFunctionNameShouldHaveBeenShortened(x,y,z));
console.log(thisFunctionNameShouldHaveBeenShortened(x,y,z));
console.log(thisFunctionNameShouldHaveBeenShortened(x,y,z));
... x 5 more times ...
console.log(thisFunctionNameShouldHaveBeenShortened(x,y,z));

etc. having the tools in vs code to autocomplete function and variable calls is great, as well as typing log-tab or lo-tab and getting the whole console.log() statement printed out for me

Why did the bullets for the list items disappear once they were changed to inline-block?

Are there any elements that are automatically inline-block? Or are all elements inline -OR- block and then setting the element to inline-block in CSS gives it the attributes of both?

Yeah, The bullets for the list disappeared… Any explanations?

Inline blocks are a non-standard list presentation with, list-style-type: none; The bullets, margin and padding are part of list-style, so once that property is removed, only the list item textContent remains.



 dacarrot24:

Are there any elements that are automatically inline-block?


Doubful, there are any. It is an arbitrary property set by the designer. Elements are either block, so take the full width of the view point, or inline so they have no defined width, hence occur inline in normal flow.

In the inline-block lesson we were told  "" Images are the best example of default inline-block elements.""
yet now you say you doubt there are any default inline-block elements. Please explain.

IMG has always been an inline element. On further testing, it would appear so, since there is no gap between them in the page when they are written inline.
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang=""en"">
<head>
  <meta charset=""UTF-8"">
  <title>images inline vs inline-block</title>
</head>
<body>
<img src=""image00222.jpg""><img src=""image00222.jpg""><img src=""image00222.jpg"">
</body>
</html>


If they were inline-blocks they would have a two or more pixel gap between them. It is my understanding that inline-blocks have that gap by default.

<img> is a replaced element; it has a display  value of inline by default, …
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img


On my website I have several ‘li’ divided into two different ‘div’ but in the same ‘ul’. I have set display: inline-block; for all ‘li’ elements but the ones in the second ‘div’ are pushed down one line. Can anyone tell me why?

Screenshot 2020-01-03 at 21.56.43828×1592 107 KB


The only direct children of UL are LIs. DIV cannot be a child of UL, but it can be a child of LI. Use LI as you have DIV, above, and treat it as a block element.

So I deleted the DIVs with class “home” and “nav” and instead assigned those classes to the individual LIs. Is that what you meant? It seems to be working either way. The reason for the DIVs where to left and right align the LIs within the header, respectively.

 mtf:

and treat it as a block element.


Not sure how you mean exactly. If I change the LIs from inline-block to block elements they won’t share a line anymore. I assume I’m missing the point here?




 pywhiz00727:

Not sure how you mean exactly.


inline-block is still block level, it just has no width attribute. Block elements are meant to be sectioning elements. They are the basic building blocks of our structure.
It would appear you are wrestling with a number of concepts. That means going back to the beginning and taking the time to read the specs on W3C and MDN. Work with one concept at a time and create single purpose practice documents WITHOUT using a style sheet. Learn the default behaviors of every HTML element you intend to use, BEFORE trying to hammer it into something that looks good. HTML in raw form is ugly, but there is a reason for every default property.

Hello,
i tried practice with these consepts : inline, block, inline-block.
i did some exercice and i understand the role of them correctly but in this example below, i can’t understad why is there a gap between the div’s? Although there is no margin, no paddnig are added to my style sheet.

tttttttt1366×660 37.1 KB

Note: whether the value of the attribute display is inline or inline-block the gap was still there.

The gap is a result of the line break in the markup code. To remove it, write all the divs on one line with no gap between tags.
 <div></div><div></div><div></div>

thank you!
is it a standard in HTML or the browsers’ default style?
can i remove this gap with another method? because when i have a big DIVs, it’s good to put this line break between them to be more readable for us.
and the worse of that is the gap has a width.

The gap is due to how HTML handles white space; and, as far as a I know, there is no way to override it. We can use white space within the element, though, and keep the tags adjoined.
<div>

</div><div>

</div><div>

</div>

HTML recognizes and treats all white space as a single space. Ten hard returns still render as one space. Ten space characters render as one space.

My question is about the exercise for this lesson.  The items with the class “answer” are formatted in the CSS code with text-align: center;, however, the answers are not centered in their containers.  I tried adding margin: 0 auto; and that didn’t seem to center them either.  Why is this, and is this something that can be corrected?

I changed the width of the class answer to 200 pxs, and now the H3 elements are centered in their containers.  But there seemed to be plenty of room to center them when the width was only 120 pxs. I even made the padding 0, and they still wouldn’t center, but the answer “disagree” for example bled into the “neutral” box, despite there being a space on the left side of the “disagree.” Can anyone explain why that is?

The H3 elements are inheriting their horizontal alignment from either the default style sheet, or from a parent. I suspect it to be the default style so we don’t need the text-align property. We also don’t need padding, which is something I avoid at most turns. For this element I have these style rules…
h3 {
  color: #466995;
  font-family: 'Oswald', sans-serif;
  font-size: 18px;
  font-weight: 700;
  text-transform: uppercase;
}

and for the answer class,
.answer {
  width: 200px;
  height: 150px;
  margin: 20px;
  display: inline-block;
  line-height: 110px;
  border: 1px solid #466995;
}

The line-height is how I achieve vertical alignment.

why was the link element (Used to link the style-sheet) written twice (Here)?
<title>Typography Blog</title>
  <link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""styles/reset.css"">
  <link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""styles/style.css"">

Was this necessary?

If you look more closely you’ll see that the links are different: one is for reset.css and the other is for style.css. Style.css would be your main stylesheet that you used in the exercise, while reset.css will override browser defaults (as I think was discussed in a prior lesson on the border-box model).

I have my own question. In step 7 it says: "" Instead of linking the font from index.html, you realize it would be a better to import Google fonts in the files directly into stylesheets with the  @font-face  property.""
Intentionally or not, it seems to imply that the  @font-face  method is better than the  <link>  method. Is that actually true, or another instance of the lesson’s wording being a bit ambiguous? I’ve read elsewhere that the two methods have similar performance, but that  <link>  might be slightly preferred.
For example see this post: https://css-tricks.com/dont-just-copy-the-font-face-out-of-google-fonts-urls/.

Sorry if my question digress away from the main topic of typography.
I don’t understand why the <li><a class=""home"" href=""#top"">FAVORITE FONTS</a></li> disappears from view unless I full screen the ‘web-browser’.  I tried to change the display property of the list element or adding float property or changing the width, but can’t seem to bring that navigation element to view.
Can someone explain why and how would you go around to display this specific element regardless of the screen size? Thanks!

What is the visual difference between the colors?
I’ve ran the code, and looked at the webpage for each code that I ran - I can’t seem to find a single difference, it looked exactly the same as before.

The colors are indeed different, albeit only slightly to us non-designers. I suggest that you take a screenshot(snipping tool if you are on Windows) before you change the color, and you can compare the changes.

All the named colors have an RGB equivalent.

https://www.rapidtables.com/web/color/html-color-codes.html

However, without resetting the lessons, I can’t recall whether darkSeaGreen was the color used for .green { }. If it was, then indeed there is a difference.
We used, #9EB599 when in fact it should be, #8FBC8F.
Can you recall the color name that was initially used?

I completely understand the concept of the lesson,
how these color code changes are intended to demonstrate different ways of expressing the same colors.
HOWEVER, THE COLORS ARE DEFINITELY DIFFERENT!!
especially going from RGB to Hex code, the shades are completely different, much cooler tones.
I think it’s time for some revision @Codecademy …lol When were these exercises made?

Please elaborate. RGB to HEX is very straight forward when we consider number base.
rgb(255, 255, 255)  =>  #FFFFFF (#fff)

255 left shifted four bits gives,
0xFF0000

255 left shifted two bits gives,
0xFF00

255 with no shift gives,
0xFF

When we combine them (as in, add) we get,
0xFFFFFF


The only real challenge, programmatically speaking, is creating the correct representation. That’s not really a problem since at a script level we’re working with strings a lot of the time. We can use padding techniques afforded us for string representations.
Think, how would one go from,
rgb(15, 15, 15)

to,
#0F0F0F

?

Hello! Thank you for your response!
I completely understand what you’re saying. As I’ve mentioned above, I completely understand the concept of the exercise. Technically speaking, as you said, the colors should look the same even when translated between different methods of expression, whether it be in hex or rbg etc. But I attached a screen shot of how the “correct translation” of color codes resulted on my screen. As you can see, they are not the same colors to the plain eye.

the colors in hex vs rgb480×731 19 KB

I assume other users who’ve commented on the change in colors have seen similar results as i have. Very odd! This is why i was wondering if the color codes that the exercise provides haven’t been properly reviewed? Could just be a human error.




 mkkeems:

Could just be a human error.


Very likely. This, like so many other reported glitches will likely remain unchecked unless it is in a Pro track. Might be something to open a ticket on… RGB not matching named colors.

Hi @mkkeems! I was curious about your comments, so I went there and took a look again. I think the colors are expected to be different.
As the exercise brings:


I’m curious as to why there are two types of decimal color syntax? Is there an advantage for one or the other in certain situations? Or was there just no clear winner which was going to be the internationally selected syntax for color?
Also, if I recall my art classes correctly, the primary colors are Red, Yellow and Blue. Why does this translate to Red, Green and Blue in CSS?




 joe_shwa:

the primary colors are Red, Yellow and Blue


That relates to pigments, which are subtractive. When we mix blue and yellow pigments under white light (or sunlight) we get green. All the wavelengths of light are absorbed by the pigment except green, which is reflected.
RGB relates to light, which is additive. When we shine a red light and green light at the same spot we end up with yellow. If we place the light sources sufficiently close, and stand back far enough, our eye does not see the red or green light, but the combination, yellow. A color TV is built on the same principle. Pixels are sufficiently small so that when we sit back from the TV we don’t see the three RGB colors, but the combination of the three. When red, green and blue are combined with full intensity we get white. Take away the blue and we get yellow; take away the green we get magenta; and, take away the red we get cyan.
Interestingly enough, those three (yellow, magenta, cyan) (and black) are the principle colors used in printing. That takes us back to pigments and reflected light.

Don’t stop there! What about spectography and what it can teach us about matter, and about the universe as a whole? Color has a larger role than just our immediate, visible world around us. It is all the characteristics that inform us about the universe.

In the last review point on media queries, the suggestion is to set the queries based on the natural breakpoints specific to your site when resizing the browser. Any guidance on how to perform that task, specifically? I understand conceptually, however, I’m not sure where or how I find that information in order to have parameters for my query executable rules…?

For this lesson, on line 5, why is the font-family, Arial, in quotations, ie,

font-family: “Arial”, sans serif;

The instructions indicate that one-word font-families don’t have quotations, and the exercises marked me as wrong when I initially tried, eg,
font-family: “Georgia”;
rather than
font-family: Georgia;
Thanks!

probably because it’s followed by a coma and then sans-serif;
It’s not just 1 font

I’m not sure that’s it javapro91079. The specified font-family florafinching is referring to is under the html root element, not a paragraph or heading element.
Interestingly, the “Arial” value of the font-family property, is highlighted in yellow, as are the other type-face, how ever the sans-serif without the double quotes is purple.
I’m guessing this is something to do with the syntax of the font-family property.
I found this: https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/f/font-family/
Which helps explain why there are two font-types separated by a comma and at the end might help explain why the Arial is in double quotes.

Why does align-items: baseline property ignores height\max-height set for #baseline .center selector and stretches center element up to height of left and right element? min-height works fine then.

I’m afraid I don’t understand why the flex items stretch when we change the height property of the flex items to min-height.
Can someone please shed some light on this?

stretch is the default value for the property align-items so if no value is specified it will automatically stretch .
Also, remember:
min-height-keeps the size of the item from shrinking past a certain size.  This will NOT keep an item from being made bigger or stretched.
height - sets a certain size to the item. With the height set to a specific value it will not shrink smaller or grow larger.
max-height- keeps an item from growing beyond a certain point. This will NOT keep an item from shrinking or getting smaller.
So… when we change height to min-height the item is allowed to stretch, and since stretch is the default value, the flex items stretch.
Hope this explanation helps.

An awesome way to learn about flex-box is flexbox froggy!

For exercise 5 (Align Items), how come only the boxes in the “stretch” div actually stretch? If this is the default value, shouldn’t this also apply to Flex Start, Flex End, Center, and Baseline? The height is not set for Left, Right, or Center boxes in those divs.

I think because the height is set to a specific value, it negates the default stretch property & value. Once we change this to min-height, the height still remains as 75px except in the stretch scenario where it stretches it

In CSS typography, fallback fonts, in the example there are quotes around the fonts  that are not required when you go to actually run the exercise?  Why?

How likely is it for a user to not have the specified font in his computer? I mean, is it actually common to specify a fallback font for every section of a stylesheet? I would  assume is not common


windows_7_fonts.PNG1452×822 104 KB

We don’t see Geneva, nor Helvetica in there. Writing only for Apple would be irresponsible for webfacing resources. Sure it’s okay as the preferred font, but anything is better than letting the user agent decide. That is the last fallback, the generic family.
Knowing that the browser is capable of going through a list of fonts and binding to a local representation if one exists, else keep trying is something we can leverage.
We start with the most preferred font that the design was intended to use, then allow for a second font that still suits the design. Failing either of the above, a font that won’t break the design but that is more generic, and failing that a generic family.

I totally agree on idea of Fallback Fonts we all use different OS,
but why can’t we have the link for the forts inside of HTML with “https://fonts.google.com/”
or this google fonts is kinda new feature?

could you please explain the difference, between small a letter font and those who doesn’t have small a on the icon ? thanks

Not sure I understand your question. Can you give us an example?

(I got the answers, in next lesson)


font.png1689×792 36.5 KB

you see, some of them have highlighted a letter, what’s the difference?

It’s been so long since I did anything under the hood this is completely forgotten, for the most part. It may have to do whether it is a TrueType font, or some other type.
See also (though only slightly related)

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_foundry

The stacking effect might indicate more than one font style, such as bold, italic, script, etc.
There looks to be three main symbols, so worth digging further into. If you can view the file extensions in the Windows/fonts folder, look for .ttf to identify TrueType.
Ten years ago I would have been able to identify more, but without a full scale review, not so today.

The instructions say to create a selector “.garamond .sample .text”. As there’s only specific classes like “regular text”, “bold text” and “italic text” (and not “text”), why does “.text” work?




 m.lo:

why does “.text” work?


Because it is a class selector, not a font.

To clarify…
“Garamond” is a font found on most systems, out of the box.
bold is a font-weight property value.
italic is a font-style property value.
Terms like regular and text are more descriptive. Mind, there are a gazillion properties in the text-____ property list.. When we write them as class selectors the term is arbitrarily chosen for its description.
If our HTML has, for instance, sections with class attributes, regular, special, aside, &c. we chose those names to give our markup some self-documentation that helps tremendously when scanning a style sheet. It also helps us to preserve structure in our realization of the design and layout.
Not only are we assigning typography information, we give those elements dimensions and position. They may have background differences (images, colors), borders, forms, &c. Keeping things organized on the screen means setting the rules in the style sheet.

Thank you for your explanation!

In the example, why is Garmond and Times in quotes but not serif? I thought you only needed the quotes if the font was more than one word?
h1 { font-family: ""Garamond"", ""Times"", serif; }
Also, is the capitalization of the font important?




 object0257697420:

I thought you only needed the quotes if the font was more than one word?


And you would be correct. The quotes are not needed, but they are not hurting anything, either, as they have no effect.



 object0257697420:

is the capitalization of the font important?


If we are certain that the parsing engine is not case-sensitive, then no, otherwise use the proper name. In grammar that means capitalized.

I’m sorry, I still didn’t get it.
In index.html there are no elements that have been assigned a class name  of “text”, so what exactly is the selector .garamond .sample .text targeting for styling?  …and how is it doing without that class having been defined/assigned in the html?

At around lines 43, 47, 51, 74, 78, 101 and 105,
class=""____ text""

The above are coincidental class names that both apply, independently. Any selector rule for either will be in force for this element.

ok, just to be sure I got it.
For the div element on line 37 of index.html  with class=“font-card garamond”
Would the css selecors .font-card{ } and .garamond{ } both target that div?




 java7142154349:

Would the css selecors .font-card{ } and .garamond{ } both target that div?


Yes, they (the rulesets) would each apply to that div.

I’m still struggling with this concept. Is there anything on the web that could explain this with a different example? I was under the impression the CSS class selector has to exactly match the class text string defined in the linked html page.

How does CSS know which HTML to style? I couldn’t find anything mentioning index.html in style.css.

In this example each section was assigned two classes, one common “container” and one unique name. For the unique names (ie. nav, header, jumbotron) why weren’t id’s used instead of classes?

Why have <div> elements been used with class attributes specifying their function i.e. header and nav? Rather than the semantic markup i.e. <header> and <nav>?
Is it because of something CSS related? I previously read that semantic HTML is better for accessibility and machine readability, than using <div>s with classes…

I’m not an experto, but if I were to withdraw some clue from what I’ve learned so far I would say that the linking, or better said the reference is unidirectional. If you notice on some html file samples, the < head > has a  with rel= and href= attributes, which tells me it is referencing the code there. As a resource, CSS serves the HTML but not the other way.
Again I apologize if this is wrong or vague, I’m just trying to apply what I’ve learned so far… anyway, enough of self-deprecation!!!  hope this brings some experts attention! @wiki-bot

For this exercise on the 6th section where it tells us to replace height with min-height, I couldn’t tell what the difference was or what the result was. Can anyone describe it to me? Thanks!

In ‘Stretch’ section blue rectangles change to take up all the vertical space. Before the change they were 75px height.
The behavior changed because ‘align-content’ is set to ‘stretch’ by default, but we see flexbox items stretching only when a minimum height or no height is specified.

Because we don’t have an explicit height value after we introduce min-height the items stretch to fill the box (apart from the bottom right corner)

Why they don’t shrink /wrap as well?

What is the difference between id and class?
I tried using the following in the index page:
h1 id=“title”>Top Vacation Spots</h1
and then use the below in the css page:
#title {
color:teal;
}
I got the same result.
So, what is the difference between these and when to use one instead of the other?

It’s all about hierarchy.
ID takes precedence over Class, and Class over Element.
ID>Class>Element.
If you wrote the following code in your CSS:

#title {
color:teal;
}

.classA {
color:maroon;
}

The former would overrule the latter and the text would be teal.

If there are, for instance, a number of p elements in the html page, how can I select specifically one of them in the css page to style only that one? Do I inevitably need to write the attribute of the element to do that?

Hello,
You would have to assign a unique id to this paragraph and then create a style for it in the CSS file.

Thanks, Virginia. I saw that the course explains this too.

If ID takes precedence over Class, then is they any real world use for Class attribute?. That’s to say why not just use ID in place of Class when selecting a specific element?

ID is used to target specific elements for styling and they are unique to the elements they have been assigned to (meaning a particular ID can’t be used more than once). Whereas Class can be used with multiple elements, this is used to style these elements at once.
So to answer your question regarding the usefulness of Class, it would be easier to set a Class to a group of elements for similar styling than to set a unique ID to each of these elements and have to style them one after the other.
Hope this helps

Why is the Syntax .ExampleClass ? Why was it decided, that the best way to recognize classes is to put a dot in front of them? Seems a bit confusing on first glance

Thank you so much this helped a lot!

If I want to target the same elements like p for example, but with different class and I want to change their style all together, can I write the CSS code like the example?
HTML
p class=“brand”
p class=“story”
p class=“news”
CSS
.brand .story .news {
}
Thanks

This part doesn’t seem to be making a difference in the sizing to me. I am still not able to see the impact of setting the widths to min and max. I mean, I get the concept and it is a great one, but I am unable to see it making any difference. So tell me how will I be able to get to see that.
Thanks.

Is it standard to use the pixel unit when setting the minimum and maximum widths while using percentages to set the regular widths?

try to change 200px to 300px-500px, and then resize the browser window, I promise you gonna see the difference.

300px.png750×772 232 KB


Hi, can I ask how to define which values to use for the min-width and max-width properties i.e. what drives the choice of values and are there any predefined values for specific devices?  Thanks!

True, 400px worked for me, I would suggest codecademy to update the tutorial to put min-width of 400px so everyone can see the difference.

According to the lesson we use px in this case to ensure hard limits on the dimensions of the elements.

Can I know please how can I get such ruler on MAC OS or any alternative please?

I solved this excercise, but it wasn’t assessed as correct. So I pressed “Solution”. I examined the given solution and my solution, they were basically the same, only the order of padding and margin declarations was different and for one “0” I had typed “px” after it.
I then took a screenshot of the given solution, reset the excercise, solved it exactly like the given solution and it still wasn’t assessed as completed. So there seems to be a bug here.

Can someone explain to me why the padding for #teal is 0 50px? I understand the 0, but I cannot wrap my head around the 50px. Thanks!

margin can be written the following way:
margin: top right bottom left

so in case of #teal that would be:
margin: 0 50px 0 50px;

which is some repetitive code, so we can shorten the code to:
margin: 0 50px;

the left and right margins are now grouped, and the top and bottom margins as well

My question is more why is it 50px when the spec sheet calls for 100px for top to bottom and 200px for left to right in the padding?

no, the total dimension of the div should be 100xp in height and 200px width. The element is already 100px by 100px from itself (width and height)

Study the following example…
HTML
<div><section></section></div>

CSS

      div, section {
        width: 100px;
        height: 100px;
        border: 1px solid black;
      }
      div {
        padding: 50px;
      }

The view…


Got it. So because 100px is the default, you only want it to be adjusted by 50px to reach 200px?
Why is it that writing the code as 200px doesn’t overwrite the default?

padding is spacing inside the element, so adding padding will expand the element. So padding and with/height can perfectly life together.
some information about the box model:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Introduction_to_CSS/Box_model

Why is this not working?
#teal {
  background-color: #A8D0DB;
  padding: 0 50px;  
  margin-left: 100px;
  margin-top: 100px;
  margin-bottom: 50px; 
  margin-right: 3px;
}

#purple {
  background-color: #414073;
  padding: 50px 50px;
  margin-left: 100px;
  margin-top: 100px;
  margin-bottom: 50px; 
  margin-right: 3px;
}


I’m wondering why its necessary to declare a margin size for the right when the exercise says it doesn’t matter what the size is??

it absolutely matters, for example:
https://jsbin.com/fakokaseno/edit?html,css,output
see how the right element is pushed because of the right margin?

Yes I’m aware it does that. I’m asking why in this lesson, it requires you to put an input when  in this lesson, it states it doesn’t matter what the value is (It states “any possible value” on the right hand side).

Excuse me, it says any positive value.

given there are no elements to the right, in this case it doesn’t matter

awesome! I appreciate the help.

kinda tricky here, I’ve created same size boxed but didn’t use padding prop

padding.png1920×926 94.4 KB


Your style rules are changing the width and height properties, which should remain at 100px as set in the .block rule. Use padding to increase the size of the boxes.

I’m confused why my code was declared incorrect when the solution gives the same results
.block {
  height: 100px;
  width: 100px;
  display: block;
}

#container{
  background-color: #F4E8C1;
 	position: absolute;
  width: 100%;
}

#teal {
  background-color: #A8D0DB;
  padding: 0px 50px;
  margin: 100px auto 100px 100px;
/*   padding: 0 50px;
  margin: 100px; */
}

#purple {
  background-color: #414073;
  padding: 50px;
  margin: 100px auto 50px 100px;
/*   padding: 50px;
  margin: 50px 100px; */
}


margin: 100px auto 100px 100px;

Does the given solution include auto in this declaration?
Or this one,
margin: 100px auto 50px 100px;

The example above can be written using two separate rules as well:
@media only screen and (min-width: 320px) {
/* ruleset for >= 320px */
}
@media only screen and (min-width: 480px) {
/* ruleset for >= 480px */
}
it should’t be  max-widht :480px ? to be equal to:
@media only screen and (min-width: 320px) and (max-width: 480px) {
/* ruleset for 320px - 480px */
}

How do you know which media query is applied if there are multiple?
In the example, the second media query (min-width: 480px) overrides the first (min-width: 320px). Is it just the further down a rule is in the css stylesheet, the higher priority?

Hi, not sure if you still need a response on this?  I had the same question but (I think!) I worked it out during the process of trying to put it down in words :0)  I think that it works like this:

Width below 320px - no media query CSS rules executed
Width meets or exceeds 320px - CSS rules stated in the 320px media query executed (e.g. set smaller font-size - which would drive any em or rem relative values that may have also been set up)
Width meets or exceeds 480px - CSS rules stated in the 480px media query executed which would either override (for example move font-size back up to level that would be more appropriate to a wider screen) and/or introduce additional rules.


What other alternatives can be substituted with keyword “screen”, the exercises mentioned print and a couple others, but are there more alternatives to make a website better?

Hi beta,  I am thinking the same thing.  why would it change from  (min-width: 320px) and  (max-width: 480px) to  (min-width: 320px) and  (min-width: 480px)?
Did you ever get an answer to this?  I read the answer from  microace but  I did not undertand it.
Thanks,
Gilbert

I think they made a mistake here and the second example should be max-width, not min-width:

Hi, in this
@media only screen and (min-width: 320px) and (max-width: 480px) {
.page-title{
width: 270px;

}
.gallery-item .thumbnail{
width: 95%;

}
}
I don’t understand the image extends between 320px and 480px. However, it takes 95% of its parent element.

Never realised my laptop screen wasn’t high resolution until now 

My display resolution is : 1366 x 768 = 1049088.  Is this my dpi?  Also, the rocket logo had blue wings from the beginning of the exercise, so I didn’t see a change when I added the media query to double the resolution.  Why is that?

Lmao, I was literally going to make the same post!

Doesn’t work on Retina display

Thanks for the explanation - I was wondering why I couldn’t get it to display the higher resolution image on my MacBook Pro (which definitely has a high enough resolution) when the code was correct!

Is there someone who sees the blue wings?.. I’ve decreased min-resolution to 1dpi and still have no changes in the logo… (my laptop doesn’t have Retina display).

Same here. MBP Retina changed the min res to 1dpi but still no blue wings. 

I’m glad I checked the forums and realized I wasn’t the only one having this issue. Hopefully this is resolved in the future. 

I have a retina display and I was able to see the blue wings on the spaceship. My MacBook pro is a 2018 model. So i’m not sure why no one else is getting the results.

Only way I got the blue wings on my 5k iMac was by editing the url link (not @media) in the main CSS code to the @2x image. My code confirms correct:
@media only screen and (min-resolution: 150dpi) {
.logo {
background-image: url(""…/img/spaceship@2x.png"");
}
}

Did you get your Answer because i want it too

Got it! here is the  method to check your current dpi How to check dpi

not sure if this is a good place to ask but I don’t really want to raise an issue with support (I guess they may be getting a lot of load with all  donated pro accounts).
Anyone else doing this part of the course and several earlier in css styling and getting horribly long (minutes) wait after hitting ctrl+enter/run?
My solutions are correct and eventually get approved, and I’m getting the same results on win and linux regardless of the browser so I guess it must be server-side 

Mine has slowed down a fair amount over the past couple of weeks and times out more often

Hi, I just found out here that Safari is not compatible with this CSS feature (resolution).
It seems that this may the reason it’s not working…

Interestingly mine has a resolution of 1920 x 1080, thanks to @m.abdullah-zubair for the direction on how to check for it.
Yes, I tried and I got the blue wings but at 108dpi. Any further attempt to increase the dpi takes wings back to normal color.  Very interesting.

Is this an error of the lesson or am I missing something?
This is a part of the explanation of the exercise:

Why does it say 300px in the exercise explanation, but 150px in the example?
Here you can see the exercise

Hello.
If you study the HTML file closely, you notice that there are two “.child” elements nested in the “.container” element.
The CSS states that each “.child” element has a width of 150 pixels. So, since they appear side by side in the container (because of “display: inline-flex;”), their total width will be 300 pixels.
I hope that provided a little bit of clarity.

It’s a really small detail, but I wish the lesson order had taught us Rows into Columns instead of Columns into Rows.
Like I said, super small detail, but it kind of irked me that the lesson taught me Columns, then Rows, then that the refactoring syntax is Rows / Columns.

When they introduced the template property, this threw me off, too!
Gotta stay on edge and not turn on autopilot is what I feel was the message between the lines here. 

Howdy!
Do we need to specify the width/height when making grid templates?
Example from lesson:
.grid {
  display: grid;
  border: 2px blue solid;
  width: 400px;
  height: 500px;
  grid-template-columns: 100px 50% 200px;
  grid-template-rows: 40% 50% 50px;
}

Can I just write:
.grid {
  display: grid;
  border: 2px blue solid;
  grid-template-columns: 100px 50% 200px;
  grid-template-rows: 40% 50% 50px;
}

Instead? Sorry for the stupid question but I dunno why we need to specify a height/width for a grid in the first few lines when our grid-template does it anyway.

Hi,
Our grid rows and columns take up the percentages of the container(here the div with class grid).

When would we use the grid-template-rows or grid-template-columns, instead of the grid-template format?

Is there a difference between “h1.special” and “.special h1”? Will the computer treat these differently and how so?




 progra_34:

Will the computer treat these differently and how so?


The browser will treat them as entirely different.
h1.special

selects all H1 elements with the class attribute set to include special,
<h1 class=""special"">Special top level heading</h1>

whereas,
.special h1

selects all H1 elements that are children/descendants of a parent element with class attribute set to include ‘.special’.
<section class=""special"">
    <h1>Child top level heading in a `special` class container</h1>

There’s no difference when I am setting font-family: cursive; in CSS
What could be the problem?

The font-family cursive doesn’t seems to work in my learning environment.

It is usually better to create a new topic. It’s hard to keep track of questions asked in the FAQ articles 

What is the browser you use? May I ask you to provide the HTML and CSS code you use and screenshot of the rendered page?

I am sorry, I don’t understand the problem.
1. Florence, Italy is a h2 element with class destination and it is written in cursive. So why do you think that it does not work?

I think I made a big mistake in interpreting the English. Cursief (sounds like cursive) in Dutch is the same as italic in English. So I expected Italic fonts…
Sorry…

No need to apologize  I am glad it is all sorted out now 

Why would it be the the h5 element “By: Stacy Gray” is not effected by the css
“.description h5 {
color: teal;
}”
?
It seems to be an h5 element as well, and I guess I missing the disconnect between that h5 element and the “Top Attractions” h5 elements.
I hope this question makes sense.

Hello @text2028556577,
As I understand, it is because “.description h5” only affects the h5 that are children to parents that have the “description” class. For example, in this exercise, all h5, except for “By: Stacy Gray”, are children of div elements that have the “description” class.

Why would you want to chain selectors instead of creating a new class and applying that to the HTML elements that you want to be styled?
For example: why would you create the h1.special chain rather than simply applying a new class such as class=“unique” to the h1 elements and then creating .unique{ … } in style.CSS? This would also allow the h1 elements to have a different styling to the other elements that have class=“special”.
Is it maybe just used when you are editing the code later and you realize that you want your h1 elements styled differently to the other elements with a class of special but have already given all of the h1 elements the class=“special” attribute?

@joshbenadie071596366 This was exactly my question too! I don’t see what the advantage is of a chain, rather than just a unique class

In the CSS course Learning CSS The Box Model, on Lesson 10: Auto, using it to center text, couldn’t you do the same thing with text-align: center; What is the difference and what situations would you use either one.

In the second example mentioned in this exercise the width has been set to 400px.
As a result the div will center the element greater than 400px in a content.
How is that possible? I thought the width is until 400px?

Good question!
I guess it is again a way of differentiating between HTML and CSS.
Does anyone know the correct answer?




 sebastianhoffmann581:

As a result the div will center the element greater than 400px in a content


The containing element can never be smaller than the 400px set width of this element. When the containing element is greater than 400px, the box will be centered horizontally no matter what the width of the outer one.



 glen.helwig:

What is the difference and what situations would you use either one


margin: 0 auto;

versus
text-align: center;

Margins do not affect text alignment. We can center the element but not have an effect on text it contains. If we use text-align on the parent to align boxes it contains, that will also have an effect on the text in the boxes.

Why is it not possible to center an element that takes up the full width of the page? Wouldn’t that just make the element appear in the exact center of the webpage?




 ironsidezer0:

Why is it not possible to center an element that takes up the full width of the page?


If it spans the full width how do add margins on either side? All we can do in that case is to center the content within it.
<p>Some text</p>

The above will span the page with the text at the left edge. Giving a text-align: center; rule will center the text.
<p style=""text-align: center"">Some text</p>

although a style sheet would be preferred…
p {
    text-align: center;
}

We can also use the <center></center> element to wrap the text node:
<p><center>Some text</center></p>

However, WCAG 1.0 advises otherwise…

Use ‘text-align: center’ instead of the deprecated CENTER element.


If you’re using a border-box though, wouldn’t that solve the issue of factoring in the margins?

There would be no margins if the element itself spans the entire width. All block level elements default to 100% and border-box would have the same effect it has on narrower widths.

I understand using ‘margin: 0 auto’ removes top/bottom margins, and adds margins left/right to automatically center an element horizontally, but why doesn’t ‘margin: auto 0’ (reversing the command) center an element vertically instead?

An age old question, and one that you’ll get a multitude of answers to. It’s also the reason we have Flexbox and Grids, since in native form, CSS takes quite a beating (as in the layout author).
The document will flow where it can and stretch all the vertical limits it needs to. Horizontal is easy to control. Set the width, and Bob’s your uncle. Height is not such an easy thing to regulate, though we do have overflow fallback if a container has a set height.
We’ve brought down a document of indeterminant size and are expected to render it, by whatever style configurations we may have contrived.
It’s like a bucket of paint that we throw at the browser and let it sort out which pixels get it. Only we do help it along by structuring and directing presentation.

Sorry but i didn’t find out how to ask my own question so i just used reply.
Why do we need to give a width to the element for CSS to be able to center the element from the left and right borders of its container using the ‘‘auto’’ value? Because if we just use the ''margin-left"" and “margin-right” properties we can do it without giving a width property to the element.

margin is fixed to whatever we set it. auto is not fixed but creates equal margins on both sides. The alternative is to use percentages for the margins but this also has an effect on container width when the browser is re-sized. auto handles this much more cleanly without affecting the container width if it is fixed.
There is a fine line that separates the two methods, as both are valid. Design preferences factor into our choice to use one over the other. There is no one better way.
Bottom line, be sure to test your document in all manner of device sizes to be sure the layout doesn’t break (responsive design), or at least breaks gracefully (adaptive design).

I was playing around a bit and tried to set the style to this:
#main {
padding: 40px;
text-align: center;
width: 400px;
margin: 1 auto;
}
I was quite surprised that the whole box was moved to the left no matter the number it was (1, 10, 100). Does that mean I cannot use different number than zero?




 patrihra:

Does that mean I cannot use different number than zero?


Not exactly, no. It means CSS does not recognize the number if it has no unit. All numbers must have a unit, save for zero. Since zero is undefined, it has no unit that can be applied (logically).
margin: 0 auto;

margin: 10px auto;

sorry I didnt understand your answer.
Why do i have to use width in order to auto center margin?

i just found in the w3schools that to center the element horizontally you don’t need to put 0 you can just write margin: auto;

Screenshot from 2020-04-15 22-43-17903×449 20.9 KB

so may someone explain are there any difference between
margin: 0 auto; and margin: auto;?

The first instruction of this lesson tells you to set the width of .pull-quote to 350 pixels.
When I run this code it does not accept it as correct. Am I misunderstanding the instruction?
.pull-quote {
  width: 350px;
}


Few questions: @mtf you there my friend?

Why not

#main {
  margin: 0 0;
  margin: auto auto;
  margin: auto 0;
}

why is it 0 for top and bottom and auto for left and right?
Thanks in advance,

In any compound property, there is a set order.
 border-width: 1px 2px 3px 4px

The above sets all four borders with their own thickness. The order is as follows,
top left bottom right

Always. When we compress it further,
border: 1px 3px

Now the top and bottom are the same, and the right and left are the same.
top/bottom  left/right

In margin: 0 auto the top and bottom have zero margin, the right and left are balanced out to be nearly the same, assuming the width is less than the parent’s width.
.parent {
    width: 100%;
}
.child {
    width: 90%;
    margin: 10px auto;
}

We can set the margin to any size, not just 0. Zero margin top and bottom means there is no gap at top or bottom.

Regarding the background-image selector, does it take precedence over the img tag in html?
Because, when we change the background-image in the css file, it overlay the image from the img in html file.
Please clarify.
Thank you.




 drrajarshimitra1975:

Regarding the background-image selector, does it take precedence over the img tag in html?
Because, when we change the background-image in the css file, it overlay the image from the img in html file.


The <img> in the HTML file is a completely separate thing to the Background Image which we are replacing in this exercise so, as far as I can see, there are no “precedence issues” or interaction between the two. The <img> in the HTML file is the writer’s avatar, and it remains unaltered at the top of the page with her name.
I’m a beginner too, but I imagine that the <img> is an HTML element because it is not a Background Image, and not in itself part of a CSS styling rule like the url("""") is.
However, the <img> is itself styled by the CSS rule set with the .writer-img class selector, and the box-shadow, float, and width properties (right at the bottom of style.css).
I hope that helps  … and doesn’t confuse you even more! 

This is not very stable, but it does show how a background-image and an img can share the same space.
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang=""en"">
<head>
<meta charset=""UTF-8"">
<title>IMG versus background-image</title>
<style>
div {
  background-image: url(search_hamburger_in_red_box.png);
  width: 86px;
  height: 56px;
}
img {
  width: 86px;
  height: 56px;
}
img:hover {
  visibility: hidden;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>
  <div>
    <img src=""search_hamburger.png"">
  </div>
</body>
</html>



When we hover over the image, the foreground is hidden and we see the background image underneath it. I cannot explain the instability (FF) but would suggest this is not a typical approach and obviously should be shyed away from, else solved. A script can likely handle it more stable fashion, though I haven’t tested it that far.

I think I understand what you’re seeing. I didn’t notice that there’s already a background-image property in the .image selector so I added a new one with the link in the instructions, this replaced the old image in the live preview and still counted the task as complete. But it looks like that first soccer image is the one in the original background-image property, and it’s not coming from the HTML code.
Looks like some other folks answered questions regarding HTML and CSS images potentially conflicting but it does appear that adding a second background-image property replaced the one that was used earlier in the same .image selector.
I guess what the lesson wanted though was for us to just replace the URL. 

background image in css or img in html, wich one should we use?

If it is window dressing, as in literally a background, then use CSS. Use IMG if it is content pertinent to the page.
IMG elements can get indexed, where backgrounds generally do not, especially if they are in the CSS folder.

Trying to confirm in my head why you would have images in your CSS rather than in html.  Is it because things like background images are best set in CSS rather than HTML?  img src tag is so familiar to me now, I’m reluctant to let it go!




 stephen.fraserstephe:

Is it because things like background images are best set in CSS rather than HTML?


Images set as background do not take up space in their respective container, and we usually don’t want them indexed, anyway.

Is it a good practice to use external image links on your website? What if an image gets removed from the server it’s kept on?




 slyfox27:

external image links


If you mean images from someone else’s site this is a frowned upon practice called, hotlinking. It is tantamount to content theft unless you have written permission from the site’s owner. Search Engines are aware of this and may discount the rank of your site. When we control the content, we don’t have to worry about it being removed.
Sites that host images such as Content Distribution Networks generally do not remove content arbitrarily unless their is a non-payment issue.
Bottom line, if it is not our own image, it should not be on our site.

Will  there be a difference between setting the font weight of a text in html to “bold”  and the use of the  tags?

I don’t understand how the description was added to the image

how do I make a word in a sentence bold whiles the remaining sentences keep the normal font weight?

Hey @mannie_29!
There are a couple ways to do it:
You can surround the word in <span></span> tags and then change the styling of the tags like so:
<p>I am <span>depressed</span> *Suddenly Pineapples* this does not help</p>

and in your CSS file:
span {
  font-weight: bold;
}

OR, you can use the built-in bold tags(<b></b>) like so:
<p>It's Muffin Time! Actually its <b>12:30</b>. SOMEBODY EAT ME</p>

Hope this helps!

What is the difference in using  in html and font-weight in CSS? Is one better than the other?

The lesson says the following about finding breakpoints:

“Rather than set breakpoints based on specific devices, the best practice is to resize your browser to view where the website naturally breaks based on its content. The dimensions at which the layout breaks or looks odd become your media query breakpoints.”

How do we know the dimensions it breaks at when resizing though? I can see when it breaks, but I don’t know what that width is in pixels. Do we just take a guess or is there some kind of tool we can use?
Thanks!

You could use responsive design mode:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Responsive_Design_Mode
Firefox has it for sure, not sure about chrome. But surely tools exist for it. Google is your friend
seems to exist for chrome as well:
https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/device-mode/

Hi,
I would also like to have a question regarding this topic.
In the examples the usual landscape width is mentioned to be 1024px.
New phones and tablets are not 1080px wide?
Thanks,
David

The simplest tool I’ve found is (on mac) to use screenshot measuring.  Simple press command-shift-4 and you will see the measure device then drag to measure.  It’s simple.  Also, to avoid actually taking a screenshot, just hit the escape key before you release the mouse or pad.

I notice that “clearfix” is being appended to the page-description class in the html of this exercise - but no mention of it in the lesson. It looks like this is from bootstrap. I see no mention of it in the CSS file of it either, if removed it messes up the way the content is shown.
Can someone elaborate on the use of “clearfix” how does it work with html and css?

i found it here:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/clear
see the note

https://www.codecademy.com/paths/web-development/tracks/getting-more-advanced-with-design/modules/learn-responsive-design-module/lessons/media-queries/exercises/breakpoints On number 2 of this excercise, asks me to re-write “.page-descirption” in order to algin the text to the left.
Why do I need to do it in a separate line if I could just include the left alignment within the first set of {} which is “.page-title, .page-description”???

because that would apply the alignment to both title and description.

For breakpoints, would that mean you can improve your website and its adaptions through trial-and-error?

Hi, where should media queries be written in the stylesheet?

If anyone else is confused by what appears to be a missing Flexbox lesson, take a look at these 2 threads 
Lessons on Flexbox?
Where is the Flexbox course?

Yup. I was confused about that. So I just started watching Flexbox tutorials on Youtube, and will now switch into the Web Development path to do the Flexbox material.
Thank for digging around!

so is html “table” outdated now? where do we use “table” and where “css grid”?
<table>
   <tr>
     <td>A</td>
     <td>B</td>
   </tr>
</table>


From what I have discovered, the answer to this is ‘yes’ and ‘no’.
Waaaay back when, tables were just about the best thing we had for creating page layouts. I had a look at one of my old websites on the Wayback Machine the other day… it was all tables  
Then we have had divs and positioning. Floats and all that. Now we have these here Grids and also  Flexboxes in the CSS3 standard. And these two layout methods are being wrapped into a new part of the CSS standard called Box Alignment.
Anyway. Tables are still a part of CSS3. They are now considered a semantic part of the standard.
So, if you need to lay out a table of data… tables are still there and will give you semantic HTML, and so they certainly still have their uses.



MDN Web Docs



: The Table element
The HTML table element represents tabular data — that is, information presented in a two-dimensional table comprised of rows and columns of cells containing data.






And not sure on the ins and outs of using grids to display a table, but I found this post which lays out how to use flexbox to create responsive tables; in the comments there is a post asking why not use tables and just apply display: flex to them, making the child elements flexbox items, and thus retaining the semantic HTML of table elements.
That seems like a pretty cool idea, and I really love this responsive table (way better than other examples that I’ve seen).
In the same way… if using a grid would work… you could use the Table element and change it to display: grid and proceed in the same (semantic, but grid-powered) manner.

Found the missing Flexbox course!

In the css provided in the exercise… Why is the the selector of the class “col” like this?
[class*=""col""]{ ... }

instead of this?
.col{ ... }

Is there any reason than it make it necessary or just to show diferent selector options in the same css file?

Don’t know if this has already been discussed, but as I was cruising around the font awsome website I noticed that the fa prefix has been deprecated since version 5. It has a new default of fas or fab. Maybe the lesson needs to be updated.

Question

Answer
A relative path is an address that points to the current directory or project folder. In the example illustrated in this lesson, the relative path is images/mountains.jpg and it assumes we have an images subfolder nested within a project folder.

Hi!! I want to know whats is the difference between add an background image on CSS and add an image on html? In this exercise, for me , it looks like they have the same purpose!

In html, you use  tag then input your url when your type src e.g img src = www.wheretheimagis.com/image
but for css, you use url command (instead of scr command in html) to fix in your image.
guess the difference isn’t much

how about if i have two folders in the same directory with my picture in one of the folders and my css file in the other folder. how do i get the relative path between the picture and the css file

lets say you have:
assets
|++ css
    |++ style.css
|++ images
    |++ my_image.jpg

you can use .. to traverse to the parent directory, so then you get ../images/my_image.jpg in your stylesheet.

Hi.
I was wondering the same thing.
I guess the answer would be in the flexibility of styling an element on your page in CSS and easily swap out the image url but keeping the styling in place.
In html (without CSS) you would have to style that specific image within the <img scr> tag being
i.e.<img scr=""http...."" height=300px width=200px border=4 align=right >
meaning that the chance for error and losing styling when changing the image is bigger
Hope that is a correct interpretation and answer to your question

Consider a <div> in which
Case I: You put image using <img> and now can you add text to <div> on that Image?
Case II: You add background image on css and now you can add text to <div> on that image.
In css it’s like we write on an Image while in html it is like we put a image on a paper and write below that image.

Is there a way to make the background image opaque, but not the caption? In other words, can I make the background image have difference opacity than the caption?
Thanks!

Why adding an image to the style sheet while we can just  put it in the HTML from the binning?
and what determines the size of it?
plus  can we add a photo to be the background of the whole page and like adding a text in another colored background?

under what circumstances would you use em/rem as opposed to just setting the font size in px?

From what I learnt from the lesson exercise on em and rem, rem is the root comparison of the entire elements in the page while em is the comparison of section by section of the page elements. Therefore, it depends on which style you want to apply. For me, the rem is easier because it is global but stylistically, em is more tasking but will give you more and better look of your design.
I hope I got it right.

My own observation here is that I could not answer pass question 2 in the exercise 3/10 for the reason I don’t quite understand. I refreshed many times as usual to get it right yet it didn’t let me move forward even though my answers were correct.
Also once you ask for a review for just one question, it gives the rest of the answers that you didn’t ask for. That’s not good for learners like me.
I wish these be looked into as I feel its a systems bug.
Thanks.

If a @media selector has both “and” and “,” (or) conditions, when is the CSS applied. If it satisfies all of the “and” conditions and if it satisfies at least one of the “,” conditions?

I could be wrong but I believe you consider the “and” conditions as a single unit. Therefore,  width: 95% takes effect in all three of the following situations:


(min-width: 320px) and (max-width: 480px) = true


(orientation: portrait) = true


(min-width: 320px) and (max-width: 480px), (orientation: portrait) = true


Please correct me if I’ve made any errors here.

I get what your saying. Now if the orientation in your scenario was landscape would it keep the whole rule from applying? With a mixture of “and” and “,” it gets a bit confusing.

How do we avoid ambiquity here? I mean this snippet could be rendered both as ((min-width: 320px) and (max-width: 480px)), (orientation: portrait), that would mean that the code executes either if the screen is 320 - 480px OR has portrait orientation;
and in the same time it can be rendered  as (min-width: 320px) and ((max-width: 480px), (orientation: portrait)), which would mean that the minimum screen-size required for the code to execute is 320px AND either the maximum size has to be 480px or orientation has to be portrait. And if it IS portrait, then the maximum size can be anything, even like 750 px… ?
So which of the two conditions is relevant here, and why?
Thank you in advance and sorry for the massive and obscure question :)))

Comma Separated List exercise.
@media only screen and (min-width: 320px) and (max-width: 480px),  (orientation: portrait) {
.gallery-item .thumbnail {
width: 95%;
}
/*ruleset for 320px - 480px */
}
I don’t understand why this code is effecting the rocket logo.  .gallery-item element is the white bordered boxes.  .thumbnail element is the images within them.
The rocket logo is within .logo element so how does this make the rocket logo appear vertical when in a portrait screen?
Thanks in advance : )

I’m also wondering about the same question… it seems that part of the task is missing, unless there’s something else?

The lesson about relative measurements in CSS says that if I set the width/height of an element as a percentage, I need to set the width/height of its parent element first. However, in the sample website’s code in the same lesson I could not find a single absolute height/width declaration in the CSS of any parent element whose child elements we had to manipulate using percentage values.
Does anyone know why the code still works on the page?
Many thanks
Adam

It could be that the parent element was taking the height/width of the browser window itself. Or that the parent element height/width was dictated by the cumulative height/width of the child elements. I’d play around with the code outside of Codecademy (using Visual Studio Code for instance) and see what you can learn through experimentation.

How do we know when to use relative measurements vs hard coded measurements? Does this mean we should stay away from pixels?

The lesson states:

It would also avoid uppercase text in the HTML file, which could make code difficult to read.

Does this mean it’s best practice for the entire HTML file to be written in lowercase?

Does this affect the type of text you are using? If you are using a text format that types in all caps will it lowercase them?

Why do we need a .bold in css when we can use the  element in html? Both will make the text appear Bold.

What will happen if two class names have duplicated modification?
For example:
the ‘title’ class will change the color to teal, while the ‘publish-time’ class will change the color to gray
What will happen if in the h6 tag at line 13, I write class=“title publish-time”?
PS: I tried it myself but no matter how I order them, the result will be the time changed to gray instead of teal.

It appears that the instructions for this lesson aren’t correlating with the code. For example, on page 10/17 its asking to add a “class attribute” on line 13, but its actually supposed to be on line-16. I tried to reload, just in case it was on my part, but nothing changed. What happened?

Actually, nevermind, this mistake was on me. I had 3 spaces in between my codes, causing empty lines. Problem solved.

What is the point of adding in a class attribute when literally all you have to do is select h6 in CSS.
h6 {
color: gray;
}
This is faster and easier. Why would I not just do this?

Because you might have multiple h6 elements in your HTML and you may not want all of them to be styled exactly the same.

If you actually change the order in style.css you will see that the one that comes up first is the one that will be applied. Not sure how that works though.

Because you don’t want to bold every single line of code.

How do you recommend to order the selectors of the CSS file?

I have two questions:
1: can i separate a class or id attribute in CSS if they are linked together with “-” ? for example: class=“large-title”
2: in the example we have to write the color “gray”, however, if I spell it “grey” is that ok, too?

total newb here.
just wondering, using selectors in css, what is the difference between writing:
h5.description {…}
and
.description h5 {…}
Please help 

I have the same question.

From the summary page of the lesson:


Multiple selectors can be chained together to select an element. This raises the specificity, but can be necessary.
Nested elements can be selected by separating selectors with a space.


So I think h5.description{} would apply to h5 elements with a class of “description”, whereas .description h5{} would apply to h5 elements nested inside elements with a class of “description”. This was explained in exercises 12 and 13.

Hi,
I am totally new to the code world, I hope what is below will make sense!
Can I select and style a particular item in a <ul> or <ol> ?
Example:
<ul>
<li> item1 </li>
<li> item2 </li>
<li> item3 </li>

How can I select the “item2” and make it for example bold while keeping “item1” and “item3” the same?
Thanks

One way is to use child selectors, known as pseudo-class selectors.
If we can assume there is only the one list, then,
li:nth-child(2) {
  font-weight: bold;
}

I m a rookie and waiting for help…
Thanks for community I got the right answer but i got confuse
what’s the different between the .description h5{} and h5{}
I can’t see any different after run…




 br3wn0:

Can I select and style a particular item in a <ul> or <ol> ?
Example:

 mtf:

One way is to use child selectors, known as pseudo-class selectors .
If we can assume there is only the one list, then,
li:nth-child(2) {
  font-weight: bold;
}



Am I right in thinking, though, that in @br3wn0’s particular example (above) just adding <strong></strong> tags within the HTML, as follows, would be more straightforward and tidier?
<li><strong>item1</strong></li>

Using the same example of targeting one particular item in a list, if we wanted to make other style changes (e.g. colour, font-family etc.), again, would it not make more sense to just add to the HTML, this time with an inline style attribute? e.g.
<li style=""colour: red; font-family: cursive;"">item1</li>

However, I’m interested to know in which kinds of situations you would consider these CSS pseudo-class selectors to be more efficient , and ‘better practice’, than using individual HTML tags or inline style attributes. 
Or is it more a matter of personal choice and style?     




 jon_morris:

would be more straightforward and tidier?


While we may wish for a list item to stand out visually, we may not wish to give it any more aural emphasis than the others, so, <strong></strong> would be semantically inappropriate.
The equivalent markup to font-weight: bold is <b></b>. Since CSS is a cleaner approach, that would be the optimum choice.



 jon_morris:

would it not make more sense to just add to the HTML


That would be a simple ‘no.’ Inline style attributes are never the way to go. Not only does it clutter up the markup, it also supercedes the cascade by giving more importance than would have a style sheet rule. Overriding inline style rules is a giant hassle and maintaining them an even bigger one.



 jon_morris:

Or is it more a matter of personal choice and style?


In CSS we are not looking for efficiencies, but maintainability and flexibility. Inline rules go right against the grain of both. Best practice would be to never use inline style rules, except perhaps to test a style. Once it is fashioned to suit, a selector rule should be created and styles moved over to the style sheet…

What is the difference between [  .destination h2{}   ]  and [   h2.destination{}   ]

Plenty.
.a b is a descendancy combinator. It applies to child elements of type b with parent of class a.
b.a is a chained combinator. It applies to type b elements with class a.

hello so in this exercise when we type
.description h5{
color: teal;
}
why the first h5 is not changin the color ? all the rest h5 changed exept that




 erikola6446890629:

why the first h5 is not changin the color ? all the rest h5 changed exept that


Because the CSS selector .description h5 only targets the h5 elements nested within (children of) elements with class=""description"".
All of the <h5> Top Attractions titles change colour to teal, because they are all nested within <div class=""description""> elements.
However, the first <h5> (By: Stacy Gray) doesn’t change colour, because it is a direct child of <body> (which doesn’t have class=""description"").
For all of the h5 elements to change colour, the CSS selector would have be just h5.

Thank you for clarifying! I was getting confused.

I have the same question

The simple answer is in an earlier post…

.a b is a descendancy combinator. It applies to child elements of type b with parent of class a.
b.a is a chained combinator. It applies to type b elements with class a.


As with many others here, I was confused with the difference between chained and descendant combinators. After googling it, I couldn’t even find a mention of “chained” combinators. I only saw descendant, child, adjacent, and general sibling. Is using chained combinators an antiquated process or something?
In any case, given:
.a b{}
or
b.a
I am not sure why it would matter if “it applies to child elements of type b with parent of class a” vs “to type b elements with class a.” Is it because child elements are different from other descendant elements?
Also, if this:
.a b{}
is a descendant combinator, why not call it that instead of the “nested elements”?

Technically, since HTML is declarative, not imperative, pretty much anything goes. If it makes sense to the browser it will be rendered. If not, the browser will still try to make sense of it so that something renders. How we package the content is entirely up to us. We could use all paragraphs, or all divisions. It doesn’t matter to the browser.
Semantic HTML is meant for readers. The reader could be human, or it could be a user agent such as a screen reader or a search engine robot. Semantic HTML helps give meaning to the markup, not the content. This helps in determining relevance and importance.

What is the difference if I write  ""h1.description{} "" or “description h5” ? thanks!

In learning to link the CSS and HTML, I have found different various ways to do this. Is there a standard way ? Or does it really matter if the “rel” attribute comes in the end or the beginning of the code?




 mf9940:

Or does it really matter if the “rel” attribute comes in the end or the beginning of the code?


it doesn’t matter, attribute order isn’t relevant.

Thank you for your help!!!

does the rel attribute always have to equal to stylesheet?

nope, but this you could have found in documentation:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Link_types

why does it say set it equal to  style.css and not ‘./style.css’ on step 2?
does a relative pathway in the same folder only need the file name and extension?




 pyjumper62515:

does a relative pathway in the same folder only need the file name and extension?


Correct. ./ is the current folder.

Are all three attributes (rel, type, and href) needed in the link element in order for the styling to be applied to the HTML document? I fiddled with it, and it worked without the “type” attribute.

the type attribute can indeed be omitted since html5

Thank you so much for that input.

Can anyone explain to me why for the link type, the order is “text/css” and not “css/text”? Or is the order not important here? Thanks in advance!




 melissa-d:

is the order not important here?


type =>  generic / specific

which translates to,.
type/subtype

text is generic and never used as an extension (subtype). css is specific and is the common extension recognized as the subtype. There are several text based MIME types, plain, csv, css, and html to name the most common.
txt is a common extension for text/plain, but there could be others. Recall that every file we create is written with a header which the user agent can extract and parse. The MIME type is written to that header. The application that created the file will be sure to give it the correct MIME type.
With HTML5, browsers implemented reading of the header so we are less expected to indicate type on css and html. For backward compatibility we can still declare them, but don’t need to for modern browsers.
Found this on MDN

MIME types (IANA media types)


In the lesson it teaches that relative links should be in the format href=""./style.css"", but the exercise instructs us to use href=“style.css” (without the period or slash). Both ways seem to work, so what’s the difference?

It’s basically the same thing, Both ways look for a file in the same folder.




Do absolute paths always point to remote files or assets? HTML


    Question
Do absolute paths always point to remote files or assets? 
Answer
No. Absolute paths may also be used to point to local files or assets. However, when linking to local files it generally makes more sense to store files or assets within the project directory itself and then use a relative path to point to it. To learn more about paths, check out this StackExchange thread.

Ok, I was doing really great understanding flexbox up until flex-basis link to lesson. I’m just having a hard time wrapping my head around this property. I understand that you’re setting a width value prior to proportionally stretching or shrinking the element. I understand what it does. Its how it works that I’m not understanding fully, wouldn’t the size of the screen effect how the element will look prior to the shrinking or stretching? How does setting a pixel value help? Wouldn’t a smaller screen hide part of the element since it has a, so to speak, fixed size set in px? Maybe I’m just missing the concept fully.

Scratch my question. It just sort of hit me that its setting a size before it ever hits the container! It is then shrank or stretched proportionally from the flex-basis size. I get it sorry about the long rambling question.

Please can someone help me with the explanation of why we need to declare min-height as opposed to using flex-basis? Why and how do we use min-height while using the flexbox?

Can someone please help me!!! I think one this is the site playing up as I’ve seen this before!!!
In the question "" 6.
In the  .shrink.center  rule in  style.css , add a  flex-shrink  value of  2 .""
Which I’ve put "" .shrink.center {
flex-shrink: 2;
}""
And it still tells me
Error!!
“Did you add ‘flex-shrink: 2;’ to the ‘.shrink.center’ rule in style.css?”

SO I was right. It wasn’t me that type anything wrong.
After waiting all day for someone to help and nobody did and so I’ve clicked the view solution button which just did the work for me. Thanks

@blog2245393326  no,you are right,i’ve presented them those problems before…they said to check my wi-fi connection lol .
But it does has to do with your browser…
I’m using Chrome and its doing better but still keep having errors when the answer its true,and even had different CSS layout sometimes under certain lessons so i was utterly confused when it asked me to change the property under certain class but i don’t even see that class.
Refreshing the page actually helps in most of the situations.

What is the default Font size??

I don’t understand it. I wrote the solution exactly, and it was still marked wrong. The only difference was that my “font-size” was orange instead of blue (which I did think was strange, but found no way to change).
I clicked on the Solution and no change happened except “font-size” changing from orange to blue.
This has got to be some sort of bug, right?

I was doing a line by line analysis of the Innovation Cloud mock-website and I had a question about font-size:
Here’s the code:
.header h1 {
    color: #fff;
    line-height: 100px; 
    font-size: 80px;
    margin-top: 0;
    margin-bottom: 80px;
    text-transform: uppercase; 
  }

When I deleted margin-top: 0; (for experimental purposes), I noticed a large white bar appeared above the background image. More tinkering revealed that the white bar was a result of  the 80px font-size of h1.
Why would increasing the font size of h1 create a white bar above the background image? The background image is in the parent class .header, and h1 is in the child class .container.

this happened to me as well

I copied the exact solution code and reset exercise then pasted it and the website kept telling me that I was wrong.

I have the same problem in learn css but in html I had nothing like this problem. My browser is internet explorer and I even downloaded google chrome to try it on there and it still does nothing.

If you put the font-size below the font-family it won’t work (turns orange instant of blue)
ex:
p {
color: AliceBlue;
line-height: 1.3em;
text-align: left;
width: 100%;
font-family: ‘Helvetica’
font-size: 18px;
}
But if you move it above it works, it might have something to do with the order in which it loads the code I’m not sure.
ex:
p {
color: AliceBlue;
line-height: 1.3em;
text-align: left;
width: 100%;
font-size: 18px;
font-family: ‘Helvetica’
}

Can the font-size of  headers be altered with CSS?

How is position:relative different in effect from using margin spacing to “move”  the element?

By offsetting from the default static position of the div using the top, left etc properties, does that not make the position command superfluous?




 jv0x:

By offsetting from the default static position of the div using the top , left etc properties, does that not make the position command superfluous?


top, left etc don’t work on static elements, nothing happens.
Besides relative and static, there also other possible values for position (fixed for example)




 plantedfeet:

How is position:relative different in effect from using margin spacing to “move” the element?


lets do an example:
https://jsbin.com/dukidawico/edit?html,css,output
if you uncomment (ctrl + /) the css, you will see that both divs move down
this is because margin is applied first, then the elements are “rendered”, causing both to move down.
if we use move (again, uncomment the css line):
https://jsbin.com/dokarohiye/edit?html,css,output
the elements are “rendered” first, and then the #first element is pushed down, causing overlap, because the second element doesn’t move.

Hello All,
Just want to know in above exercise we have 5 question classes(.question) and we gave them

postion:relative;

and offset

top:40px;

so my question is why this offset top 40px applied to only first question class why it have no effect on other question classes?




 sahilgoyal01996:

so my question is why this offset top 40px applied to only first question class why it have no effect on other question classes?


Are you sure? Have you tested this hypothesis? Go ahead, and only apply the top: 40px to the first question. (use an id selector or nth, whichever you prefer)

Yes Sir I tested this,
My style.css

.question {
text-align: center;
position: relative;
top:400px;
}

I change 40px to 400px just for a proper change
Here is index.html code
 



[Album] Imgur





as you see there are 2 div’s with class name question
my output is
image 1
 



image 2
 



as you see in Image 1 there is proper 400px gap between top and question 1 but in Image 2 why there is no 400px gap .As i know if i am giving 400px gap from top to class question than every div who have class question should have gap of 400px from top.

now you still apply the top: 400px still to all questions, not only the first one
anyway, as explained earlier (please checkout the jsbin example as well):



 stetim94:

https://jsbin.com/dokarohiye/edit?html,css,output
the elements are “rendered” first, and then the #first element is pushed down, causing overlap, because the second element doesn’t move.


So all the questions move down, but because they all move down an equal amount (40px, 400px or whatever value you give them), the relative distance between the questions stays the same.

Thank you very much sir
It cleared my doubts

I  added  the position - top 40px in the class “question”, There is only changing top of the first question box but why another questions box`s  top  are not changed?  They are also included to class “questions”.

Hi,
Thanks for the responses but still not quite getting this. I played about with your jsbin. This is the start position, before we add relative positioning:

(can only add 1 image per post right now so will reply again with next step…)

Part 2:
Then added relative positioning. In this example, I see what I would expect - each relatively positioned element has the additional space above it, relative to the last (static) element:

Really struggling to work out the difference between the lab case and this case.
All clarifications gratefully received!
Thanks

debugging from screenshots is very difficult, couldn’t you post links to the bins?

Hi stetim94,
sorry, first time I’ve ever seen jsbin so not sure what you mean - could you clarify what links you mean.
Thanks

Believe this is what you’re after but let me know if not - Thx



jsbin.com



JS Bin
A live pastebin for HTML, CSS & JavaScript and a range of processors, including SCSS, CoffeeScript, Jade and more...






well, in the lab (the codecademy exercise) all questions are positioned relative. which means you have a few relative elements after each other, while in your jsbin example you have relative and static element alternately.

Ah, this is because the answer class element is a sub-element of question class element so we position relative to the previous question as opposed to answer, as I have tried to simulate? (apologies if terminology not correct - early days of learning…)

yes, seems you understand it correctly

In this lesson ( [CSS Documentation and Debugging]) it ask you this :
In the “Values” section, find a value that will turn off the display of an element. Add a  display  property with that value to the  h1  rule in the  @media  query at the bottom of  style.css .
but nowhere does it say what to set the max width at, after i clicked the get help button it sets the media query as a max width off 800 px, why did it choose 800 px specifically? in our former lessons where they gave us the reference guide on when a screen breaks for tablets and cell phones and other screens,  800 was not a number any of them fell on, so why was 800px chosen?

why are there two css links at the header of the html?

why do we use  not other element

There is a mistake in theory, I think you should say 40 percents:
We can also mix and match these two units. In the example below, there are three columns of width 20 pixels, 40 pixels, and 60 pixels:
grid-template-columns: 20px 40% 60px;


It isn’t really a mistake seeing as the grid width is 100px, so 40% is the same as 40px in this case.

In CSS selector, can I indicate a specific element in HTML. With just p selector, It’s going to change the all p elements in the HTML, so I wonder how can I designate one element by using selector in CSS.

I am geting CSS course, on one practise a cant go next…but I thing that I did it right…
In  style.css , add a selector for  <h1> elements. then Inside the curly braces of the  h1  selector you just declared, write:
color: maroon;
I did this: h1	
{
color: maroon;
}
Whats wrong?

p, h1 {
font-family: Arial;
color: maroon;
}
me too but this is solution is ok finaly

Sorry for late response to your question, but it’s looking specifically for the first { to be on the same line as h1, like so:
h1 {
color: maroon;
}

what if we wanted to specify our tag say we had two <p> tags what would we do if we wanted one to be
red and one to be yellow

In the upcoming lessons (same section) you will learn about classes, ID’s where you will learn to assign different classes to different elements and then you can style each class.

Can you write the code either way?
h1 {
color:maroon;
}
OR
h1 {color:maroon;}

Hi @net4447221503
Despite the fact both ways work, you should always stick to the first syntax as that’s the standard for CSS.
h1 {
	color: maroon;
}


I’ve typed in the code correctly and it’s given me a tick and allows me to go onto the next page, but my code has not changed the example at all.  It’s still Times New Roman and in black.  What have I done?  My code is
h1 {
color: maroon;
}

When styling an html element with css, I noticed that the course tells us to write: “color: maroon;”
This is obviously American English. If I use British English (“colour: maroon”) or other British spellings in future css lessons, will it still work?

I was stuck with this as well, even the solution code did not work.  I switched browsers to Chrome from Edge and it works perfectly now.  This must be an issue with the environment within Edge.

my header won’t change color.

Why this property is used because I have not noticed any changes in the website on the right side?
I also used all of It’s values mentioned.

grid-auto-flow …
using column  will push the 2 added Recipes into another column.
using  row   the 2 added Recipes appear at the bottom of the page.

In this exercise when we use  the property grid-auto-flow: column; this property reorganize container to fit in the remain space.
The first and second column has a margin on the left and right side that you can see only using inspection.
But the third one that was fit on the  right side don’t has this margin.
How to solve this issue?

1.JPG646×831 71.8 KB

To solve this I had to make some changes:
ORIGINAL
main {
display: grid;
grid-template-columns: 250px 250px;
CHANGED
main {
display: grid;
grid-template-columns: repeat(auto, 250px);


When I use grid-auto-flow: column;   , not just the newly added extra elements filled the columns from top to bottom, but all the contents did.
So it works on not just implicit elements?

This technique is great to be aware of. Thanks!

I don’t notice any difference in the example website when I assign a value to Grid-auto-flow.  Is it me or is it the exercise?

In the right-most window (browser view) of the exercise, there is a pair of diagonal arrows. You can click them to switch between full and condensed views of the browser window.
As @propokeruk mentioned, if you use grid-auto-flow: row; which is the default, you will see the two new duplicate recipes (sweet churros and berry parfait) appear at the bottom of the rows.

abce1366×768 256 KB

If you use grid-auto-flow: column; the new recipes will be added in a new column.

Thank-you for replying, the screenshots of how it should look are very helpful! I did try to expand the window as you suggested during the lesson and there was no change. I reset my code, did it again, expanded all windows - I tried it all, i think, and it was still coming up squished together at the bottom of the 2nd column. Now I know what to expect though, so thank-you for taking the time 

This is a really useful information .Thanks from my side. 

Not sure if this is the right place to ask this but…
How do are we positioning the child elements like the h2 and p so  that they always appear underneath each other?
I understand that the div is the container but how do we position text within that? (maybe I’ve missed/forgotten a lesson
cheers

Not entirely sure I understand the question. Perhaps you will elaborate if I am misunderstanding the issue.
In index.html, we have the <main> tag. Within the <main> tag, we have a series of child divs. Each of these divs has the class “recipe” and also another class which is unique for each div e.g. <div class=""recipe a""> and <div class=""recipe b""> etc.
In style.css, we have set some rules for the <main> tag which specify how we want the children of the main tag to be displayed in a grid.
Additionally in style.css, we also have rules for img, h2, .time, .recipe, .mins, .description which help us further customize how the elements within each div are to be positioned.

Thank you mtrtmk!
I have been creating separate divs for h3 and p elements to get them into the position i wanted, rather than using the CSS styling with class.
After your help and a few more youtube videos I have managed to place them into the desire position. (I will keep working on it)

In the exercise, I didn’t include grid-auto-column in the code and the grid-template (grid-template-columns: 250px 250px;) is set so that the grid only has two columns. So why did grid-auto-flow: column added a new column when the template says there should only be two?

From the documentation for grid-auto-flow:
row
Items are placed by filling each row in turn, adding new rows as necessary. If neither  row  nor  column  is provided,  row  is assumed.
column
Items are placed by filling each column in turn, adding new columns as necessary.

Oh… I get it now. So basically, the template of two 250px columns are what is called explicit while the ones added by the auto-flow is implicit. That’s why they don’t actually contradict each other.
“grid-template-column” sets explicit columns
while
“grid-auto-flow: column” adds implicit columns
I see, thanks!

I have a problem but idk why, when i have my website screen in small window it looks fine, like this:
wtf1920×1040 602 KB
but when i go in full screen it looks like so:
wtf21920×1040 338 KB

In your top screenshot, you are missing a rule within the the main selector of your style.css file. Perhaps, you need to reset the exercise for the rule to reappear (it appears for me just fine, perhaps it was accidentally deleted in your file.).
Alternatively, you can add the rule yourself.
The relevant rule to be added within the main selector is justify-content: center;
That should fix the problem you are seeing. If you omit/delete this rule, then the justify-content property takes on the default value of “normal” which can result in behaviour similar to your screenshot.

In what kind of context would it be better to use content-box model rather than a border-box model? If the border-box model makes calculating the layout easier, is there a reason why you wouldn’t always use only that one? Are there disadvantages to the border-box model?

where is the proper place to add the universal selector?

Do you have to declare the new box model at the beginning of your code or can you place in any location? In addition using the * can you set other universal defaults within CSS?

Can you please explain how you advance to the next screen in this particular Box Model Exercise. The first Instructions are to experiment changing the Height, Width, Padding, etc. and then the Next button never turns yellow to go to the next screen. How on earth do I advance please?

I have no idea what I’m doing wrong with this one. I cant’ see any difference between what I have done and the solution. I just copy and pasted the code from the instructions and it doesn’t work. Is there a glitch in this one?

You don’t have to put it in the beginning of your code. For example:
CSS
    .earth {
      border: 5px solid black;
      height: 200px;
      width: 300px;
      padding: 20px;
    }
    
    
    .mars {
        border: 5px solid black;
        height: 200px;
        width: 300px;
        padding: 20px;
        box-sizing: border-box  
    }
    

HTML
    
    <h1 class=""earth"">Hello Earth!</h1>
    
    <h1 class=""mars"">Hello Mars!</h1>
    
    

Throw this into the Code Academy interface, or Visual Studio code, and see what happens.

I have no idea what I am doing wrong!!! It’s driving me mad! What should I do please? HELP!

The universal selector * was used to define the rule for box-sizing. Why not use the body selector?

Firstly welcome to the forums system9428163692.
Secondly, I am still very new to this myself, but if I understand this correctly, if we used the body class selector, we would only change the box properties for that one elements box. If we use the universal selector *, we then target all the elements boxes on our page. ie the p element. Happy to be corrected here but that is how I understood it.

I’m getting a bug on this one too, doesn’t work when typed in (checked, checked and checked again).  Using the view solution button worked, but matched my code exactly.  Running Chrome 83.0.4103.116 64-Bit.

A post was split to a new topic: Conflicting css property resolve order

I have question, what is the need of “id” specifically when the same can be done using class elements ?

ids are unique, so you when having ids you know you are dealing with a single element on the page. This can be very useful when your page grows and the number of elements increases
furthermore, ids have a higher priority when it comes to resolving conflicting css properties

So you mean I can use ids only on one element on the web page… is it just to look unique ? I tried using another id too it worked… we create those id’s right, we ourselves have to give the priority according to the need right ?




 laks27:

So you mean I can use ids only on one element on the web page… is it just to look unique ? I tried using another id too it worked…


yes, unfortunately browsers do support multiple ids, which is a shame. So now its your job as developer to ensure unique ids



 laks27:

we create those id’s right, we ourselves have to give the priority according to the need right ?


no, css uses a point system to resolve conflicting css properties. ids will have more points then class and element selector

Thanks stetim94 for clarifying the doubt.

In part 8 of this exercise, in the style.css file I wrote a CSS selector for class attributes, and then in part 9 underneath that I wrote a selector for an ID attribute. When I added the corresponding ID value to an h1 element in the index.html, having not deleted the class value written from the part 8, I noticed that the CSS for the ID became displayed in the browser.
Does this mean that CSS selectors for IDs overwrite those for class even when the ID selectors are written lower down in the hierarchy of the cascade on the style.css file?




 dellaesque:

Does this mean that CSS selectors for IDs overwrite those for class even when the ID selectors are written lower down in the hierarchy of the cascade on the style.css file?


that is part of it, the other part is that css uses a point system to resolve conflicting properties (the higher the specificity, the more points). Which looks like this:
element: 1 point, so for example p is 1 point
class: 10 points, so .class_example is 10 points
id: 100 points, so #id_example is 100 points
using the style attribute: 1000 points
so .class_example p would be 11 points
given ids have a higher specificity, the ID will always overrule the class selector in case of conflicting properties (so even if you place the ID before the class selector)
if the points are equal, the latest property gets applied
this even applies when you have multiple stylesheet:
<style>
p { color: red }
</style>
<style>
p { color: blue }
</style>

the paragraph will be blue, even if those stylesheet where external (so with <link rel=""stylesheet"" href=""#"">)

That’s a great explanation. Thank you.

what’s the difference between the id and the class

ids should be unique (unfortunately not enforced by the browser), so we as programmers should enforce unique id’s. Furthermore, ids have higher specificity, which is important when you have conflicting css properties for an element

Does the ID attribute overrides Class attribute in CSS. For example if the class selector for an element has color red,and ID selector for the same element has color green.

I haven’t tried myself, but I do know that id would override class because a class is made to target multiple element whereas an id is only made to target that one specific element

id has a higher specificity, so the color would be green.

i can’t understand what’s the difference between  ( id ) and (class)

have you read the topic so far? within the topic you can find explanations about the differences:
a class is made to target multiple element whereas an id is only made to target that one specific element (credit to sgr524)
the uniqueness of ids also comes in handy when working with forms for example (to associate input field with a label)


This is how my text ended up looking. I am far from an expert, but I would not call this cursive. Did I do something wrong? I checked all my code, but I can’t see anything.
My code in CSS:
#article-title {font-family: cursive;
text-transform: capitalize;}
And in index:
h1 id=“article-title” class=“title uppercase”>Top Vacation Spots</h1
(with the brackets obviously. I had to remove them because otherwise it wouldn’t show the code)

My text didn’t end up in cursive, either:

I also triple checked all my code and it looks correct to me:
index:
h1 id=“article-title” class=“title uppercase”>Top Vacation Spots</h1
css:
#article-title {
font-family: cursive;
text-transform: capitalize;
}
Any assistance would be greatly appreciated!!

In this exercise it says:

You can look up the font you are using to see which font-weight values are available.

I understand the fact that some font families may have more font-weight values available than others, and that some may only have one (the default value). I’ve had a quick look to see if I can find some suitable reference material which lists available font weights by font family, but so far I can’t find anything.
Can anyone suggest something?
Or is it easier, and therefore more usual, to just find this out by trial and error?
(My understanding is that if a particular font-weight value isn’t available for a particular font family, then CSS will automatically render the ‘nearest’ one available according to a fallback weight rule.)


FAVORITE FONTS
There are few lines in ths topic which i camt understand … so plz help
why this is using     nav class=“header”
and  why this          a class=“home”         .?


I’m not sure I fully get what you don’t understand, but hopefully this will help…
I think the fact that a value of ""header"" has been used for the <nav> element’s class attribute is purely a decision of the coder. It seems logical to me as the navigation bar is also a kind of header, and if the page had more than one navigation bar (and therefore more than one <nav> element) the class=""header"" would allows us to select this particular one individually. But, I also think this could equally have been class=""navigation"" or class=""anything else"". The point is that this <nav> element can be selected for styling with a CSS class selector of whatever word is chosen as the class's value, which in this case is .header.
There are four navigation buttons, but only the “Favourite Fonts” one is to be styled blue. That’s why the <a> element that renders the link for this button needs a different class value to the other three (which are all class=""pagelink"". I think the coder has chosen class=""home"", because this button takes you back to the top of the page (a kind of “home”), although I admit it would seem more logical if the button also said “Home”. But again, I don’t think it actually matters what word is chosen as the class's value. What’s important is that, whatever this value is, it’s used as the CSS class selector to style the element according to a specific CSS rule set - which it is, as follows:
a.home {
  color: #4D00FF;
} 

Hope that helps!

I don’t know if this will help you Jon, but if you click in to each font on this webpage I’ll link, it lets you test out different weights. The few I tested I only saw a change between bold and normal, even though the picklist also has ‘lighter’ and ‘bolder’ for a total of four weights.
https://www.cssfontstack.com/Web-Fonts

Thanks @agentgenx - but like you say, for each font on that linked web page, there only seems to be a difference between bold and normal. I find it hard to believe that there isn’t more variety available for some fonts…

It’s entirely due to the font-family creator. They can determine how many variants of ‘boldness’ to employ. Good font-families will usually employ a wide variety, though it is common to import only a couple for rendering purposes

Since the valid values are multiples of 100, why don’t people just use 1-9 instead?

I’m curious - what effect will assigning a font-weight of 700 on a font-family that only has a 600 and a 800 (but no 700) weight font have?
Is it possible to ‘break’ my code if I assign a weight that the font-family doesn’t have?
How do browsers typically interpret mistakes in assigning weight?

Refer to MDN. Here is the link for font fallback rule.



MDN Web Docs



font-weight
The font-weight CSS property sets the weight (or boldness) of the font. The weights available depend on the font-family you are using.







Why are font weights listed using a 3-digit number if only multiples of 100 are valid, as mentioned in exercise 4? Why not just use 1-9 instead of 100-900?

I found Google Fonts to be a great resource when researching fonts and available weights - https://fonts.google.com/

Don’t quite get the css below. It means “home” class within “a” element?
a.home {
color: #4D00FF;

When you add the overlap element in point 4, why is it covered by the right element but not the left?

Why is the  overlap  element not covered by the  left  element?

Even after using the z-index on my code, the ‘overlap’ element is still covered by the ‘right’ element

It because file is executed in a sequence.Check Index.html file.Plus if you change the position of right and overlap class and run it you will notice overlap block is no more covered by right block.

Overlapping Elements
“Another powerful feature of CSS Grid Layout is the ability to easily overlap elements.
When overlapping elements, it is generally easiest to use grid line names and the  grid-area  property.” …what???
Can you please EXPLAIN why you’d want to overlap elements or give (show) just one example?? Or better yet, what overlapping elements even means (besides the obvious of elements overlapping one another)??
This lesson really becomes frustrating and simply falls apart in the teaching department …somebody just gave up trying to explain basic functionality and began copying information directly out of a very tedious and very dulltextbook.

What happens if a grid-area is not set for an item existing in the html code? thanks

Hi! Why do we have to set the z-index to 5 as opposed to a lower number, like 1? Isn’t the default z-index of the other elements 0? Thanks in advance.

I’d also like to know this. I tried it with the value of 1, 2, 3…all the way up to 10 i think and no values changed the outcome. I’m guessing it would if there were more elements and they were all overlapping each other. But i can’t work out why the numbers make no difference.




 amircea97:

Why do we have to set the z-index to 5 as opposed to a lower number, like 1?


As per my very rudimentary understanding, using a z-index of 1 would work as well. I suspect they picked the value of 5 arbitrarily. I think picking a value of 5 just gives a bit of leeway in that if the coder decides to play around with the depth of other elements at a later time, then he/she could just assign the element(s) a value in the range of 1-4 (or 5+ if the other element has to be positioned on top) without having to touch the existing code. If the “overlap” element of the exercise had been given a value of 1, and then later someone wanted to change the positioning of some other element, then the z-index of the “overlap” element may also have to be edited. Just guessing. I could be wrong.



 helen8297:

But i can’t work out why the numbers make no difference.


In this particular exercise, only the “overlap” element has been given an explicit z-index value. Unless you pick a negative value, giving the “overlap” element a z-index of 1 or 5 or 10 will not make a difference. If you gave some other elements a z-index and then played around with the numbers, then you will see the numbers making a difference in regards of which element comes up on top. Here are a couple of useful links:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/z-index
(You may want to have a look at the CSS Demo as well as the example at the bottom of the page)
https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_pos_z-index.asp
(Click ‘Play it’ for the number property in the property values section to play around with an example)

How do we have other elements and content wrap around the overlapping element? Looking at the example, the “overlap” element is on top of left and right. If we have content in the “left” and “right” elements, how do we make the content to wrap around and not be drawn on top by the overlapping element without off-setting the content away from it?

Hopefully, one of the mods or other people well versed with CSS would be able to answer this.
I gather the issue you are trying to solve has to do with:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48031648/text-not-wrapping-in-css-grid
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48721924/floating-elements-in-css-grid

Hi. Remember in some math class you took about graphs or geometry? the x, y, and z co-ordinates? the same logic applies to CSS z-index with the base being the body of the document at zero relatively. Using CSS you can put any element(text,image,sound/music file/ video file) on the z axis relative to the body is my understanding. Think of it as a 3 dimensional grid layout like you would see in any 3-D graphics creation program such as Blender, Maya, Illustrator to name a few except since we are using HTML and CSS the whole of it is displayed in two dimensions like on television. Hope this helps. Have a good day.

One solution to having text wrap around say an image is to set up the grid with more columns and rows:
t = text and I = images s = background
tttttttttttt =12 columns of text
ttttiiiissss = 4 clolumns of text, 4 columns of image, 4 columns of background
ttttiiiissss = 4 clolumns of text, 4 columns of image, 4 columns of background
tttttttttttt = 12 columns of text`tttttttttttt =12 columns of text
If you look at the stuff i put up above and think about it in terms of CSS lay-out. I think and hope you get how you could wrap text around an image.

A practical use of overlapping elements would be when you want to have a semi-transparent picture or text above a couple of other elements whether they are some solid colors or images.
HTML and CSS are both processed on an old computing principle. LIFO(Last in first out). the last code line from top to bottom when reading the code will be the first out. The way we as humans read it and the order the cpu processes it is the same. If you have the .right first then the .overlap next then the .left last in order from top to bottom as you read it the the overlap will only overlap the .right unless you put the z-index greater than zero to the .overlap element. This the shortest best way I could think of explaining this at 1 a.m. after a days work and then going to school on-line here to learn HTML and CSS. Hope it helps someone along. Have a good night.

In this exercise, where the height of .grid container is not set up  and the rows template is expressed in fractions only, how does the browser calculate height of each row? Does it assume that the grid container is a square (height=width)?

I don’t think it assumes the container is a square. If height is not specified, then I think it defaults to height: auto. Hence, the height of the rows would be determined by the content. Whichever row’s content would result in the largest height, that height would be automatically used for all the rows. I am not entirely sure though.

I think you can use float to wrap around stuff, i’m not sure if it is still in use though.

In this exercise we created multiple selectors h5 and p and made a font-family property set to Georgia, specificity from high to low would be ID , CLASS and TAGS respectively but in this lesson creating an h5 and p selector and making its font Georgia changes all h5 and p elements. how come in the code below h5{color:rebeccapurple;} doesn’t override all the h5 elements but in this exercise it overrides all h5 and p elements eventhough they have the same specificity in the previous lesson Chaining and specificity? Is it because were declaring a change to a different attribute and property which is (font family: Georgia;)  ?
.description h5{
color: teal;
}
h5{
color: rebeccapurple ;
}

p {

and this later on down the line:
h5,

Why are we listing two separate font-families for p elements? Should the Arial one be eliminated?

Why did the items that had the stretch property by default expand when I changed height to min-height, but not the other elements? Does the alignment prevent them from stretching in any way?

In case it’s useful to anyone else browsing the thread:

In the 5 id selectors in the exercise’s css, we’ve set these to the other 5 possible values for align-content (e.g. flex-start, flex-center), where each represent one of the 5 non-default options for align-content.
Only the value stretch expands the flex-items to fill the parent container. As we haven’t set anything for the stretch id in the css, and as stretch is align-content's default, this takes effect for the final group when we set a min-height rather than a fixed height.

In the example in this exercise, the dimensions of the container and child were declared using pixels.

Could rem have been used instead?
If so, what effect would this have had on the flex-wrap: wrap; and align-content: space-around; declarations?
In this situation is it preferable to use px or rem to declare dimensions?

Why does setting a min-height rather than a fixed height cause this to take effect?

After we changed the “height” declaration to “min-height” the boxes stretched. Why?
I’m asking because although there is an id named “stretch” in the html file, there is no declaration for it in the CSS file.
So, are flex items, by default, stretchable? If yes, why did we use the id ""stretch in the html file?

I didn’t see real changes until I erased the width of the white container, this parent element was not responsive even thought display was set to flex. Is there any error in this excercice?

Maybe I am not understanding the ‘flex’ and ‘wrap’ elements but in this exercise the boxes hide from view when you shrink the browser. I was expecting them to shrink and/or go to the next line.

under flex-grow, why do flex items display side by side when the container is set to flex? i thought flex meant children divs would remain block level elements.

Quote from Codecademy: A div with the declaration display: flex; will remain block level — no other elements will appear on the same line as it.
However, it will change the behavior of its child elements. Child elements will not begin on new lines. In the exercises that follow, we will cover how the flex display property impacts the positioning of child elements.

If I assign flex-grow 1 to only one item and do nothing to anything else in the container is there anything that is supposed to happen?

Hey, any idea why my macbook has coped fine with everything on the web devs course so far but in chrome the tab (only this one, all other tabs are fine) crashes after the .bottom.side and .bottom.center are given flex values and I resize the window?
Everything else has worked perfectly til now and the browser tab consistently crashes just on this one step.
Cheers,
Laura

The default value of flex=grow is 0 so any positive value added to an item will affect a change

On “Space-around” how this space are calculated? how can we decrease the space?

Hello, I assumed that if we want to apply flex properties to an element first we declare it is flex like;
display: flex;

But in this example, tutorial asked us to use justify-content property to change layout of the flex items. Should we tell that these items are flex first?
Here is the practice code;
body {
  border: 0;
  margin: 0;
  font-family: 'Roboto Mono', monospace;
}

h1 {
  text-align: center;
  display: block;
  font-size: 18px;
}

.container {
  height: 150px;
  width: 100%;
  display: flex;
  background-color: whitesmoke;
}

.box {
  height: 75px;
  width: 100px;
  background-color: dodgerblue;
  border: 1px solid lightgrey;
  display: inline-block;
}

#flexstart {
  justify-content: flex-start;
}

#flexend {
  justify-content: flex-end;
}

#center {
  justify-content: center;
}

#spacearound {
  justify-content: space-around;
}

#spacebetween {
  justify-content: space-between;
}

Thank you.




 selimimre7005752898:

Should we tell that these items are flex first?


If we can assume they are all members (children) of .container then they all inherit that property.

And I was suspicious why no one left such question but me! I haven’t noticed the flex declaretion in the .container. I looked twice but obviously not careful enough.
Thank you very much for your answer and time.

When changing the li elements to tomato  in the video why wasn’t the following CSS code used.  Seems repetitive to do it twice or am I missing something?
body, 
a {
  color: tomato;
}


In this exercise, we saw that <div> was used to organize the content of the webpage. Wouldn’t it be better to replace <div class=""content""> with <main class=""content""> and further modify the example to reflect the proper semantics? I also noticed <div class=""image""> and <p> used in place of <figure> and <figcaption>, among other things.
I imagine this was for demonstrative purposes, but I felt it was worth mentioning.

Hard to replicate what happened in the video and cannot even proceed because droid serif not available on google fonts and i need to pay for it on another site it links to, please fix this as it made me skip the rest of the typography lectures and project.

I am also having touble continuing with the Linking Fonts video exercise.
1st problem no sound, seems like its locked in mute (check volume icon)
2nd problem video image won’t advance although the progress bar advances.
hope this helps and would love the feedback.

I can’t watch the video, maybe it’s is too large…

Could someone guide if I’m misunderstanding the concept here?
If a user doesn’t have a font I used when developing a website, then the user will not able to view the page in the format I intended to.However, if I link the fonts as explained either in Linking Fonts I or Font Face I explanations, then any user should be able to view the page in the intended font is that correct? Or is there still a possibility that some users are not going to be able to view some of these fonts?

So what’s the answer then??? ?

Yes, that is correct. That is the entire point  of the lesson.

I’m having the same problem with the sound. Can’t hear anything. Are there any other ways to view the video?

You can continue with the lection by using the links provided in the “hint” section.

I tried following the steps in the video to add the font (Droid Serif). However, the page directs me to a Monotype external Foundry, which requests fees in exchange of adding the font

This lesson was so confusing… the images and the text doesn’t match. One image has "" "" in the font-family property, the other one has ’ ', and another image says it doesn’t have "" "".
The image says it is .tff format and the text says it is with a double t = .ttf
¿?

I wish they had some sort of video walk through, would happily pay more to learn.

Ok, something is screwy in the #18 typography font-face 3 lesson. On “instruction #2” I did the correct syntax according to what was asked and it still will not work. I eventually just pressed the hint button and it mentioned using the “…/”
So why not add the two periods in the example picture in the instruction area where there is an example pic of the thing that is being taught?
I will show a pic of what I mean. Please fix this. It’s a simple thing but its still confusing.

There are also other typo mistakes in this lesson. This is the first lesson I’ve noticed with mistakes like this.

This lesson  on Font Face III was some of the most confusing to me.  One instruction says to open code editor and go to the font section to view path.  It would be helpful to have video on this.  The syntax is not explained either of commas vs semi colon to end a multi value statement  in this lesson. So many parts to it.

There should be more in depth  instructions on the actual syntax.  I used a semi colon “;” instead of a comma “,” when there is multi part values in this part of the lesson.   I have been  CSS section for  2 weeks off and on. Not a programming language in the OOP  sense.  I start 6 month boot camp  in 2 months for full stack. Coming from .Net SQL background this seems like it needs a giant reference manual to use this.

the amount of dots show how many times you need to go out of your file  where you’re now ( style.css) to get to the file you want to get to (Glegoo-regular.ttf). So basically, you are going out of the FILE (which is in this case is named style.css) (one dot), going out of the FOLDER (named styles) (another dot). once you made clear that you want to go out 2 times, you make a / and write the FOLDER you want to get in(font) and then another/, and then the file in the folder (Glegoo-regular.ttf).
in short: you go out, out till you are out of every file or folder, then you go in, in, till you are at your desired file.

shouldn’t /files/fonts/Glegoo-Regular.ttf work?

@cryptowell @jmfeld @shoquim @saalr @zmanphx @kantucky @michaelv.g @mtf
I also found this exercise really confusing, and I agree it could be written/explained much more clearly.
I’ve done some digging, and I want to share with you all what I’ve found out 

Relative path
Here you’ll find a good thread which I joined, and which gets to the bottom of the differences between using:
url(""../fonts/Glegoo-Regular.ttf"")
url(""./fonts/Glegoo-Regular.ttf"")
url(""/fonts/Glegoo-Regular.ttf"")
url(""fonts/Glegoo-Regular.ttf"")
I also really like @saalr’s explanation about what the number of . means:



 saalr:

the amount of dots show how many times you need to go out of your file where you’re now ( style.css) to get to the file you want to get to (Glegoo-regular.ttf). So basically, you are going out of the FILE (which is in this case is named style.css) (one dot), going out of the FOLDER (named styles) (another dot). once you made clear that you want to go out 2 times, you make a / and write the FOLDER you want to get in(font) and then another / , and then the file in the folder (Glegoo-regular.ttf).
in short: you go out, out till you are out of every file or folder, then you go in, in, till you are at your desired file.



Use of quotation marks with the url( ) CSS data type
According to https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/url#Syntax, the use of quotation marks is optional, and if you do use them, you can use either single or double ones.

Use of quotation marks with the font-family property’s value
From what I can gather, best practice is to use quotation marks where the font-family value (i.e. the name of the typeface or font you want to use) includes white space (e.g. it is more than one word); whereas quotation marks are not required when it is a single word or hyphenated. e.g.
font-family=""Helvetica Neue"", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
However, as @zainabrawat explains here (where she answers similar queries to ours about this same exercise), in practice things are less clear cut, and there are instances when it still works (i) omitting quotation marks from names with more than one word, and (ii) using quotation marks with single-word names. 
In the same post, you will also notice she confirms that when quotation marks are used, it doesn’t make any difference whether you use single or double ones. In fact, this seems to be the case throughout HTML and CSS whenever quotation marks are required. Could someone confirm this?
However, she does suggest that hyphenated names should have quotation marks, which contradicts what seems to be standard practice with sans-serif, for example (and as I’ve illustrated above). Maybe, @zainabrawat could clarify this?
I think what has confused some of us regarding the use of quotation marks in the font-family declaration, is the fact that, in this exercise, task 1 won’t allow Glegoo without quotation marks in the following rule:
@font-face {
  font-family: Glegoo;
}

(i.e. it only allows this rule with the value ""Glegoo"" or 'Glegoo').
I think this is an error, especially after discovering that, after having completed the rest of the tasks in this exercise, this @font-face rule still works if you delete the quotation marks from Glegoo that you were forced to include before.  
Further evidence to suggest that Glegoo doesn’t need quotation marks is the fact that task 3 does allow it within the .banner p rule set.
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-family#Valid_family_names has some more detail and examples on using quotation marks with font-family names, if you’re interested. (But personally, as I’m still a beginner, I found the extra detail here a bit too much, and at risk of confusing me again).
I’m going to submit an error report for this exercise, with a link to this thread. I don’t think the issue is so much that the information and examples in this exercise are wrong, but more that it’s very confusing and could be explained a lot more clearly.
Anyway, I hope this has been a helpful round-up!

So what I’ve found out is that:
CSS has a generic family and these fonts shouldn’t have quotes around them.
other fonts can be quoted or left without.
Read More w3.org

I typed in exactly what you’ve recommended it still doesn’t work! Eventually I gave up got the automatic solution - and what was typed in there looks identical to what I had put in which didn’t work :S
This is the first exercise which has had me stumped

Instructions:
"" In the  fonts/  directory, you’ll notice that we have added several local font files.""
I’ll do what? Where is this directory?
As of now there are two tabs I can look at index.html and style.css .
I think I understand, this means that fonts have been added in a folder serverside in a relative location to the index file right? But how would I notice that?  This instruction just mentions it like it’s some no problem easy thing we should all notice naturally  and I have no idea where I can notice this…
EDIT
yeah, I found out what was ment now:
@font-face {
font-family: ‘Space Mono’;
font-style: normal;
font-weight: 400;
src: local(‘Space Mono’), local(‘SpaceMono-Regular’), url(https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/spacemono/v4/i7dPIFZifjKcF5UAWdDRYEF8RQ.woff2) format(‘woff2’);
unicode-range: U+0000-00FF, U+0131, U+0152-0153, U+02BB-02BC, U+02C6, U+02DA, U+02DC, U+2000-206F, U+2074, U+20AC, U+2122, U+2191, U+2193, U+2212, U+2215, U+FEFF, U+FFFD;
}
thats the part this is referring to… but that did not come to me as easyly as the casual mention in the instruction implies. This might do well with an a bit more detailed explanation as what to notice for untrained eyes.
EDIT
"" Let’s change the typography of the banner, using local font files. If you open up the  fonts/  directory using the file navigator in the code editor,…""
Wait, WHAT?
OK maybe I didn’t get it anyway.
I Have no idea what file directory we are talking about and i have no idea what the file navigator is…
EDIT
Ok, now I found it.

image.png1676×1093 194 KB

I suggest changin the text to:
Let’s change the typography of the banner, using local font files. If you open up the  fonts/  directory using the file navigator in the code editor (look for the folder icon to the left of you style.css tab), you’ll notice that we have added local font files  Glegoo-Regular.ttf  and  Glegoo-Bold.ttf .

I was wondering why there is no lesson on using the @import declaration to load external fonts?
Especially since when you go to Google Fonts, one of the things you can do is to copy the prepared @import statement and paste it into your CSS.
This is the method I have used in the past, which is is a nice one-liner compared to the @font-face  method of loading external fonts.
Is there some reason why this is not mentioned? Is it not recommended for some reason?

I wonder why this is so, too. Is there anyone to explain this?

This is by far the most baffling lesson on the Codecademy CSS module.
Why do we need to put a double period before /fonts/Glegoo-Regular.ttf , when we do not need to do the same for any of the other relative paths?
Why doesn’t the example code feature quote marks ("" "") around the urls?
Why does the example code refer to one font file as .tff instead of .ttf?
In part 3, why do you no longer need to use quote marks around Glegoo, when you had to use them previously, in the font-face section?
From the comments here, it seems this exercise has been completely borked for at least 9 months. I realize that many of my questions have been answered by other posters, but why hasn’t Codecademy fixed anything?

Any idea if that’s actually required for the code to work, or if it’s just a common convention that this exercise requires? This kind of stuff should really be explained in the lesson.
Update: I tested it for myself and found that it works fine with or without the dots, so I guess it’s just something to make it more clear to someone reading the code where to find the font file.

thank you for the clarification!  had no idea what they were asking for.

This lesson was a pain in the ■■■. Only confusion and bad explanations.
The solution in my case was about the use of marking quotes:
@font-face {
font-family: “Glegoo”;
src: url(…/fonts/Glegoo-Regular.ttf) format(‘truetype’);
}
Just don’t write double quotation marks “” to wrap the URL inside the () and in the format Truetype use simple quotation marks '.

Hey @tortillazo!
Would you care to expand on what you didn’t like about the exercise in the bug report? We here on the forums can’t change the exercise to make it less confusing, but if you sent a detailed bug report to the actual Codecademy staff who can make the changes you want.
Hope this helps
Steven

What is the benefit to make a block element an inline element?

Would it be accurate to say that inline elements are counted as content by block element

sometimes putting elements in different codes with separate the paragraph putting it inline will keep the flow of text from breaking

If inline-block combines on same line & adding heights & widths, can you not amend width & height on inline elements? I have played around and not been able to. Would it then be best to place it in an inline-block?
thanks
Andrew

""In the example above, the  <em>  element is  inline , because it displays its content on the same line as the content surrounding it, including the anchor tag. This example will display:
To learn more about  inline  elements, read MDN documentation.""
Um… so does the rest of the sentence…

In the inline display explanation, it says that inline elements such as <a>, “cannot be altered in size with the  height  or  width  CSS properties”.
In the previous exercise however we edited a Dave’s Burger website. In that it had a button at the bottom with a class of “button” that was an <a> tag:
<a href=""#"" class=""button"">ORDER NOW</a>
In the CSS for this website the “button” class had the following properties:
.button {
border-radius: 4px;
color: #05A8AA;
display: block;
font-weight: 700;
width: 200px;
padding: 20px;
margin: 40px auto;
border: 1px solid blue;
}
Width is defined here for the button that is an <a> tag.
Could you please explain why width is ok to be used in this case?
Thank you.

Hello Markholding,
It’s a good question and the lesson said clearly it’s impossible to set the height and width of an inline element.
anchor’s element is by default inline so you’re totally right, but look better the CSS code you post and i’m sure you’ll find why the height and width property can be use in this case… There are a "" display: block "", so the anchor is not a inline element but a block element in this case 
Sorry for my english 

Thank you for your reply. That makes sense now. Thanks

It seems like HSL is a much better option to use than RGB. Are there instances where RGB would be the preferred method? How about Hex?

Well, this is a late reply AND I’m far from being experienced. Hopefully, someone will chime in that has a more experienced answer. From inspecting the open tabs in my browser and a few bookmarked pages, I saw mostly hex being used and then a couple had RGB. I didn’t see any HSL. Is there a certain way that is preferred? I know all are acceptable. Is it just a personal preference?




 gregbutler1016:

Is it just a personal preference?


Mostly yes.
I don’t like to use hex, it’s not readable and you are not able to specify alpha (opacity). So it’s a lot better to use rgb which can be easily transformed into rgba if you want to add opacity. Hex makes sense when you are working on a really old legacy project that has to support IE6 (for example).
Most of the time I use hsl and hsla. Simply because it is readable. It’s easy to make colour lighter/darker, more/less intense, or even change the hue (if you remember how the colour wheel looks) without needing to use a colour palette, you simply change one of the values (h - hue, s - saturation, l - lightness, a - alpha) and the result of this change is easily predictable.

Above applies to web development. In the data science / machine learning projects it’s common to use different colour spaces. In one of my last projects, I decided to convert all the images that were used as a training data to a Lab colour space because it approximates human vision and that was crucial for the model I was building.

Thanks for the quick response! I see how different projects would require you to come at it from different ways. Understanding how they all work is the important part I suppose so that one could apply what is best suited for the project. HSL does seem the easiest to work with or the easiest to wrap my mind around for sure.

is there any extension to find what color’s cod(hex or rgb or hsl) is that?

Just wanted to make note of what I’m perceiving to be an error in the lesson here. It states:
“You can add opacity to color in RGB and HSL by adding a fourth value,  a , which is represented as a percentage.”
But earlier, we were told that alpha is represented as a decimal number from zero to one.




 chip4474912890:

represented as a decimal number from zero to one.


It can be either. They are both treated as a percentage. 0.1 => 10%. The decimal does not need a unit but the percentage does.

Thank you for the quick answer!

Are these equivalent? This is instruction 2 in the section 15 of grid css. I tried the first line below and it was not accepted but seems to give the same result as the second line.
grid-template-columns:repeat(2, 25%) 2fr 1fr;
grid-template-columns:25% 25% 2fr 1fr;

It is the same but we still need to keep in mind what the instructions ask for. There is no mention of using repeat(), so it is not expected by the SCT.

HTML class is called  “box a” but when I was doing the last exercise (Grid essentials review page 15) CSS only accepted .a {   }   Why didn’t it accept .box a ?




 primavera91:

“box a”


These are co-classes, which means they have two separate rule sets that both apply.
 .a {}

would be one such rule set;
.box {}

would be the other.



 primavera91:

Why didn’t it accept .box a ?


That is a descendant selector that matches an anchor element in a .box class element.
.box .a

matches an .a class element in a .box class element.
The only way we can use both selectors in one rule set is by combining them,
.box.a

with no white space (indicating descendancy). The above selector will match only to an element with both .box and .a classes.

“5.
Make the box with class  a  take up the first two columns of the grid.”
only accepts:
.a {
grid-column-start: 1;
grid-column-end: span 2;
}
as an answer.
Shouldnt:
.a {
grid-column: 1 / span 2;
}
be valid, as well?

Valid, yes, but the SCT may not be expecting it in that form. If we are being instructed in the individual properties, then that is what we should follow. Shorthand properties will likely follow shortly.

We were instructed in shorthand before this summary. The summary asks us to do the shorthand version in exercise 7  but if the syntax is correct, better even, and we have already learned it, it should be a possible solution regardless. This way I wondered if I had misunderstood the shorthand version for quite a bit before reverting to the more elaborate statement, only to then be promted to do the shorthand version. Seems a bit silly that the exercise requests the less optimal solution  after we have learned something more optimal. Just feedback. The course as a whole is great!

i dont think i have learned anything from the whole grid module. Maybe someone could make a video in it?

I want to ask about the PupSpa project…
Why is it that the ‘address’, ‘hours’, ‘call us’, and testimonial elements don’t fill up their entire row in the mobile view (width < 600px)? I tried many different ways to try and fix this, but could not find a solution, it’s very frustrating.
The other elements, such as the banner and ‘about us’, do span the full width of their row. I don’t see any difference between the ‘about’ class and the ‘box’ class that would make those two behave differently. Any help? Thanks!

Does anyone know why?

.box a 

…would refer to an <a> HTML anchor element inside the .box CSS class selector.  However, this exercise contains no <a> anchor elements in the HTML.
.box.a

…You could do this (making sure there’s no white space between the classes), but it would serve no special purpose.  The .a selector is all you need to affect the HTML code.

Try to think about it as a series of steps going from general to specific.
Step 1. We need to figure out how big our container is. Determine this with height and width properties in the .grid class. For simplicity’s sake, make the height and width the same size. (In px.)
Step 2. We need to figure out how many rows and columns we have in our container. Determine this using the  grid-template-rows and  grid-template-columns properties in the .grid class. For simplicity’s sake, make four rows and four columns, and make all rows and columns the same size ( 1fr value for each one).
Step 3. We need to change the size of our grid items (A thru E in the HTML). Create classes in the CSS for each grid item class (.a, .b, .c etc.) and start changing their sizes around using grid-row-start / grid-row-end and grid-column-start / grid-column-end.
REMEMBER: The space you are moving the items around in is 4x4 (4 rows and 4 columns). You can of course change the number of rows and columns along with everything else.
When you’ve got a handle of how it works, try refactoring your code to make it more efficient.

It should not matter.  Using repeat() produces exactly the solution that the problem asks for per point.
We are not automatons… and we were taught the skill in order to apply it.

There’s a mistake in the last exercise in Slide 15.
It doesn’t allow you to use “grid-row-end: span 2;”, it only accepts “grid-row-end: 3;” as the right value, At the same time, the Hint tells you to set it to “grid-row-end: span 3;”, which is incorrect.

For the CSS Chart Review, why am I required to use “span” for items spanning multiple columns (“grid-column-end: span 2;”), and to use specific end lines for items spanning multiple rows (“grid-row-end: 3;”)? I had thought these two approaches for spanning items could be used interchangeably. Thanks

Currently pulling my hair out on section 15 review, instruction #3. It says to create 2 rows, both 200px in size, but it appears that nothing I enter works. Here’s everything I’ve tried:
grid-template-rows: 200px 200px;
grid-template-rows: repeat (2, 200px);
grid-template: 200px 200px / 25% 25% 2fr 1fr;
I’ve tried multiple variations of each. Each of those creates 2 rows, 200 pixels tall, but the instructions still give me a red X. Am I messing up or is this section bugged?
Edit: Here’s how it looks in context:
.grid {
border: 2px blue solid;
height: 500px;
width: 500px;
display: grid;
grid-template-columns: 25% 25% 2fr 1fr;
grid-template-rows: 200px 200px;
}
Edit 2: I ended up forcing the course to solve it for me just so I could move on. It showed the answer as grid-template-rows: 200px 200px; so I guess it’s bugged.

Hey guys!
I received an error message when I used the following code to create a grid column for the first two columns of a grid:

image990×736 67.6 KB

Isn’t using grid-column 1 / 3, the same as including a property grid-column-end span 2? Just want to make sure my understanding is correct.
(Note I updated my message as it wasn’t very explanatory initially - sorry!)

Cheat sheet needs correcting.  It makes reference to a “minimax()” function (should be “minmax()”.


Please post a link to the cheat sheet you mention above. Thanks.

why is the value of z-index is 10 here?




 harpreetks:

why is the value of z-index is 10 here?


The number is arbitrarily higher than zero. It could be 1, or 100, or 1000 and not matter so long as it is higher than the element we are attempting to overlap. All elements have z-index = 0 by default.

Just curious, does codecademy have the fixed and absolute positioning rules backwards?  It seems like the lesson was saying when the position of an element is set to absolute it should scroll with the user(when I did it, it didn’t do that), and when it is set to fixed, it should stay fixed on the page and not go with the scroll(which is what happened when I scrolled).  I don’t know if I misunderstood the article or if the developers got it wrong.  Who knows?

So the higher the z-index value is, it becomes the top???
What is the default z-index values of position fixed, absolute and relative?
Like if some elements overlap each other and with each one, they had position absolute or relative or etc, which one goes on top??

z-index applies to normal flow. How it applies to position: fixed and position: absolute will take some experimenting.
Yes, when elements overlap, the one with the higher z-index will appear on top. The default z-index value is, I believe, zero, or in general terms, no elements have the property.
When we have two elements that overlap, the one with a z-index property will likely be on top. Some experimenting will prove this out.
Save your experiments, both the HTML/CSS and a screenshot. Share your findings, please.




 mtf:

z-index applies to normal flow .


I know these two things are not exactly the same thing… but the lesson states that z-index does not work on static elements.
This means we can apply z-index to any non-static element; i.e. an element with position: relative, absolute, or fixed.

So it appears to me z-index is applied to elements that are either (or both) moved from their default position or taken out of the normal flow, and applies to all elements on the page (in the sense that static elements respect any other positioned element having a z-index).

I’m just trying to grok your quote and square it with the above; can you shed any light?




 antonjw:

grok your quote


It is clearly my interpretation that lacks polish; grok away. Finally somebody is willing to do the leg work. That’s a step above beginner level when a learner actually begins to verify information they read, or at least follow up on it.
Beginners are not very good gleaners. They catch the chips as they fall. Learners, on the other hand are fledging gleaners. They know what they’re putting into their basket, even if it is a bit foreign. It will all come out in the wash.
You are at the wash tub and clearly see there is something amiss. Kudos for spotting that. Not only does it mean you’re paying attention, it also means you’re doing the follow up reading to correct these slights that miss the mark. In the process you’ve gained deeper insight. Somehow I  feel like this is mission accomplished, if a bit subversive.

I was also confused about that at first, but I believe that what the mean is that an element with its position set to absolute will scroll off the screen while a fixed element will remain in its position and not be scrolled off but instead scroll with you.

it has the same function when i place z-index: 10; and z-index: 1; . both of them no longer covered by other elements when i scroll. I just wondering, what is the difference between z-index: 1 and z-index: 100; ?

The obvious difference is one number is higher. That means it will get priority if it is the highest z-index, so it will appear on top.

Why is the welcome  able to cover the header . Even though further z-index of header is set to 10 but even though the header  was able to cover all the question s but not the welcome  initially. Just curious, what is the reason ? Since both the question  and welcome  have position:relative I’m unable to get the point.








The only element that should have a declared z-index property is the header. All other elements will have a default z-index (undeclared) of 0. Does your welcome class declare a z-index?

Wow. That’s a very good speech. I am amazed about how well you communicate to people. Such wisdom!

Could you explain,  how the following code works? Am I right that the first property is more specific than the second one?
If so, why do we encode the second “display” rule, especially since it seems to conflict with the first?
.images .image-container {
display: inline-block;
width: 50%;
}
.image-container img {
max-width: 100%;
height: auto;
display: block;
}

You are right in saying that .images .image-container has a higher specificity than .image-container img
There is no conflict as the first rule (.images .image-container) controls the 2 images at the bottom of the page, the one with the camel and the map. By setting them to display: inline-block we are allowing the 2 images to sit next to each other as opposed to on top of each other. Now remember that we are targeting the <div> with class=""image-container"" within another <div> with class=""images"", this means that the first picture, the one with the market, will not be affected as that picture does not fall within the <div class=""images"">.
Here is the HTML:
<div class=""image-container"">
        <img src=""market.jpg"" />
</div>

<div class=""images"">
      <div class=""image-container"">
        <img src=""camel.jpg"" />
      </div><!--
      Adding comment to ensure no whitespace between inline-block div elements from HTML file.
      --><div class=""image-container"">
        <img src=""map.png"" />
      </div>
    </div>
</div>

Notice how the market picture does not fall into .images .image-container, and so there is no conflict.

Why didn’t we use width instead of max-width. Since overflow is set to hidden then the content overflowed will be hidden from view anyways.

Hi
In this lesson it ask us to:

set the  display  to  block . This will instruct the images to behave as block-level elements and facilitate scaling (as opposed to their default inline behavior).

it states that changing the images default display to block-level will

facilitate scaling

Could you please explain how block-level img are able to scale and inline and inline-block aren’t?
Thank you.

Is there a way to control height or width when using minmax(). It seems the property changes at random when adjusting size of the entire grid…

I agree. In this specific exercise, setting the lower bound as 50px, my grid doesn’t appear to ever approach this value, even when significantly narrowing the browser window.

Hello!
Can I use the minmax function in the condensed version of the grid-template or do i need to specify the separate columns and rows?
Any help is appreciated.
Thank you!
Sara

The issue is that the other columns are sized with fr and will only split up what’s left of the width after the others have taken their share. This means the middle column takes it’s max of 300px as long as the grid is wider than 300px.
It is a pretty bad example to show off what minmax does.
But set the first column to a fixed 200px and you will see that it works fine. In a wide window, A is 200px, B is 300px and C takes up the rest. When you are narrowing the window first C will shrink until it can barely contain the letter C then B will shrink until it’s 50px wide and then a scrollbar appears at the bottom of the window because the grid is now at the absolute minimum width.

Thank you, I had the same questions I could stretch the middle columns to max 300px, but I could not reduce it to min 50px…Now it makes more sense.

The minmax() enables us to restrict the range of row or column size. But what determines the size of these attributes? And what would be the default value of the row or column in question.

Hey everyone, I need help with page 8, Instruction #2. It says "" Using  minmax() , change the second column to be between 50 pixels and 300 pixels."" I can’t seem to figure out the correct way to do this. Here is what I have:

Adding minmax(50px, 300px) right after the 50%, which is indeed the second column, adds another column and messes up the size. The examples in the lesson shows it embedded in the same way, so what am I doing wrong? Thanks to anyone who can help!

Update: I figured it out. It doesn’t want you to make that 50% between 50px-300px, it wants you to literally replace it with that. Here is the correct code:

I wish this was more clear, but it brings a question. the minmax(value, value) adds a column instead of specifying the previous one? I guess that makes more sense than what I thought. It basically is saying “Hey, make a new column between 50 -300px based on the device.” Would it max out the 300px if the device was wide enough?

quick question : instead of using h4 on the more destinations sections , is it possible to also use em or b to get the bolder text with the same outcome?
Thanks,
Taj

Why we need to use “p” instead of “title” in the .css document? As the exercise oriented, I copied and pasted the lines between  ; the it only ran when I changed “title” by “p”"".
Thanks""

Using <p> will allow every paragraph tag in the html doc to be affected. I’m not sure if <title> is something that would go in css, as far as I’ve learned, the <title> element is just for naming the tab of the web page at the top of the browser.

Since no one answered, I’ll through in my 2 cents. I can tell you it’s definitely POSSIBLE, since I just did it after reading your post. I wasn’t aware that the <b> and <strong> tags were the same size text as the <h4> tag. (I’m guessing you meant the <strong> tag in your post and not <em> which puts it in italics.)
With that said, is it practical or semantically correct to do so? I not sure, but I’d guess probably not. Seems like a doc filled with other header tags, should also use the <h4> instead of swapping it for the other ones. Someone smarter than me can explain better.

Strange, the exercise asked me to cut and past the CSS element from the HTML into the CSS sheet but it was already there…

Where the p came from in style.css file. That is not mentioned anywhere in ‘Learn’ section.




 karinnaomi4479758005:

The p refers to the paragraph element in the HTML.
Putting p in the CSS file means that whatever code you put within the curly braces (font-size, color, etc) will only affect the p paragraph elements in the HTML

I did the exercise instructions but the paragraph didn’t change to Arial when I ran it. Even though the box got checked and next lit up like I did it correctly.

quick question:
Learn CSS: Selector and Visual-Step 4 asks to do the following.
Cut the CSS code in between the opening and closing  <style>  tags and paste it directly in the new file called  style.css .
I did what was asked and I’m getting an error asking “Did I remove the paragraph style from index.html and put it in the style.css?” Yes I did and this is what I cut and pasted 

That’s because you haven’t linked the style.css file in the  of your HTML file yet. It’ll be covered in the following lesson.

I had the same experience. The only thing I saw different from what was shown in the solution was that my line of css did not have a semi-colon at the end, which should not be required. There was also no indication of what was wrong. I tried both deleting the style tags and leaving them empty with the correct property defined for the p selector and I got this error as well.

hi, i encountered the same error, please where you able yo solve it? if yes please share with me the code because i am stocked here.

Both the strong and em tags deliver a degree of importance to the text that CSS or b don’t deliver. Semantically it’s not correct to replace a h4 tag for b or strong tag

The way this is described is confusing for beginners. The wording used in “4. The .css file” makes it seem like you should place the inline “p style=“font-family: Arial;”” into the .css document, when in reality you need to place the actual .css formatting into the document for it to work.
Ex: p {
font family: Arial;
}
An edit to clarify would be helpful.

I’ve tried this but can’t move to the next step. What am i doing wrong?
I ended up viewing the solution which was exactly what I’ve typed. What gives?

I had the same problem and realized (at least in my case!) that it was being very picky about the formatting/indentation of the code. I had to remove all indentation from the CSS code and have it flat, like this:
p {
font-family: Arial;
}
for it to register. Also don’t forget the hyphen (-) in “font-family”!

I also got the same problem. But the solution is…
In HTML, the head section should have remain empty style tag. And CSS file as like as instruction.

This post, from a different thread, relates to the topic of this exercise.
In it, I’ve asked a few questions about the differences between, and use in CSS of:

fonts
font families
web-safe fonts
(web-safe) font stacks
generic fonts

It’s all been sending me a bit   !!
So any enlightenment would be greatly appreciated! 

I’ve now come to some conclusions about the queries I had (linked to in the above post). If you’re interested, please find them here, and please confirm, clarify, amplify or correct as you see fit 

For the fun of it, go to the control panel in Windows, or whatever panel if not and look for Fonts. Open that folder. Are there any names in the list that are not capitalized?
We can hope and trust that the browser will support our guffaw of not capitalizing, but should we put that on the browser? Those names are capitalized for good reason. They are a class of object. Class names are capitalized. But that goes beyond the realm of just CSS. If you find you have a case-sensitive user agent then be glad of that. You’re less likely to form bad habits writing in that environment.

Speaking of good practice,
single quote and double quotes which one should i use?
  font-family: 'Courier New';
vs
font-family: ""Courier New"";
or in HTML:
<h1 class='test' >  vs <h1 class=""test"">
i know they both will work well in all browsers but is there a real difference between them ?




 hossamokasha76917137:

single quote and double quotes which one should i use?


It won’t matter which we use, but consistency is a good thing. For my own part, I always use double quotes on HTML attributes whether hard coding or dynamically generating it.
p = '<p class=""topic"">Lorem ipsum dolar&hellip;</p>'

That is a JS example of a generated element, what I call an HTML string.
In CSS I tend to use single quotes on everything. More by habit than anything else.

When I did this exercise I initially created a new rule set h1, h2 {font-family: Georgia}, which was accepted as correct, but I wondered if it would also be ok to add new font-family declarations to the existing h1 and h2 rule sets, so I tried that, and it was also ok. Writing one line of code seems quicker, but I’m guessing it would be better to limit the amount of rule sets as much as possible? (As in my second answer.)

Is it possible if I want to change border-radius of only two sides?

Use a couple of these properties to get two sides only:
border-bottom-left-radius: 15px;
border-bottom-right-radius: 15px;
border-top-left-radius: 15px;
border-top-right-radius: 15px;

I’ve tried padding, vertical-aligning, text-aligning, and reviewed The Box Model in order to center the h1 text within the circle-shaped 100% border-radius white margin and none of that has worked so far.
How can I pull this off?

h1 {
  width: 3em;
  height: 3em;
  line-height: 2.8em;
  border: 2px solid teal;
  border-radius: 50%;
  text-align: center;
  margin: 1em auto;
}


Height and width need to be the same, and we achieve vertical centering with the line-height property. Horizontal alignment is done with text-align and centering of the H1 is done with the margin property.

I was playing around with the border-radius and I ran into something…
When I raise the pixels of the border radius to 60px the letters over lap the border.
Why wouldn’t the letters adjust accordingly to the border? Doesn’t the content need to stay inside the border?
Thanks

When I use line-height, it spaces out each line of the text, spreading out the paragraph, but what if I want the text to still be compact together and centered in the circle? I am trying get the text vertically arranged in the center, it’s currently sticking to the top side.

We can only use line-height if there is no line-wrapping inside the button. Shrink the text to a few characters as possible and set the font-size sufficiently small enough to fit inside the circle. Then line-height will work as expected.
There is another possibility which will need more structure. Put a container inside the circle and give it a top margin to center vertically, then text align center the text. Be sure the text doesn’t overflow the container.



 ricardomilan71167004:

Doesn’t the content need to stay inside the border?


Sorry for the late answer. Text will stretch the container to whatever size is needed to contain it all.

Hi, I tried reading  up on line-height but I still don’t get what it does here. What line are we talking about here?
If it is the height of the space above and below the text, then shouldn’t it be 1.5em to get it to center vertically?

We specify line-height as a single value. It has nothing to do with centering, albeit a convenient way to vertically center when used explicitly for the purpose, with no wrap. . The property is balanced so we don’t need to consider margins or padding. This will explain why we set it to the container height.
The property is really intended as a way to space the lines in a paragraph. line-height: 2em; is effectively emulating double line-spacing on a manual typewriter. The above technique piggy-backs on the mechanics.

Hi Roy, thanks so much for the speedy reply!!!

The material says “You can create a border that is a perfect circle by setting the radius equal to the height of the box”. But should it say  “You can create a border that is a perfect circle by setting the radius equal to the 50% of the height of the box”?




 design7322393511:

But should it say “You can create a border that is a perfect circle by setting the radius equal to the 50% of the height of the box”?


Either approach is valid. There may be a best practice style guide recommendation which would be accompanied by the reasoning. See what comes up when you search for ‘CSS style guide border-radius’.

 <percentage> 
Denotes the size of the circle radius, or the semi-major and semi-minor axes of the ellipse, using percentage values. Percentages for the horizontal axis refer to the width of the box; percentages for the vertical axis refer to the height of the box. Negative values are invalid.
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border-radius

A circle is a form of ellipse where the semi-major and semi-minor axes are equal; i.e., 100% of the width and 100% of the height.

QUESTION:
In the lesson:

""(…) You can create a border that is a perfect circle by setting the radius equal to the height of the box, or to  100% . ""

But I think that it should be 50% is enough to create a perfect circle (or an oval if W/H aren’t the same value) because radius is height/2.  In fact, I’ve been testing and it works with any value from 50% to 100%.

In the Border Radius exercise in CSS, what do the numbers in the brackets stand for in the following code section?:
border: 3px solid rgb(22, 77, 100);




 me3happyft6186705970:

rgb(22, 77, 100)


That is the color function, which we give three arguments. The first is the value for RED, the second, the value for GREEN, and the last the value for BLUE. The range of those values is 0…255.

347,What combinator selectors should I be familiar with?,"FAQ,CSS FAQ",,5,"
Question
What combinator selectors should I be familiar with?
Answer
Developers will see descendant and child combinator selectors often, but should also be familiar with adjacent sibling and general sibling combinator selectors.
Examples of each:
/* Descendant Selector - will target all elements with a class of ""my-class"" 
that are a descendant of a <div> element (including a direct child, 
children of children, etc) */
div .my-class {
  ...
}

/* Child Selector - will target any elements with a class of 
""another-class"" that are a direct child of a <p> element */
p > .another-class {
  ...
}

/* Adjacent Sibling Selector - will target any <div> element that is the
next sibling of an element with an id of ""unique-id"" */
#unique-id + div {
  ...
}

/* General Sibling Selector - will target any <p> elements that are the
next siblings of an element with a class of ""class-name"" */
.class-name ~ p {
  ...
}

","
Hello,
Could you help clarify the CSS selectors you mentioned by providing HTML examples of what those combinations look like?
Thank you very much.

div .my-class

<div>
<p class=""my-class"">A descendant of DIV</p>
</div>

p > .another-class

<p>A paragraph with a <span class=""another-class"">direct child</span></p>

#unique-id + div

<div id=""unique-id"">

</div>
<div>
<!-- selects this adjacent sibling IF it is a DIV -->
</div>

.class-name ~ p

<div class=""class-name"">Not this one</div>
<p>This one</p>
<p>This one</p>
<p>This one</p>

Be sure to verify this with some follow up reading.

Beautifully illustrated, thank you !!

I tried to type this without a space between div and .my-class and it didn’t work. After I added the space, it worked. Why do we need a space in between div and .my-class?
And in this exercise, it needs a space between article and .receipe? Thanks.

What is the difference between <a> and <link>?
Can they be used inter-changeably?


In this exercise, I’ve become aware you can add an image to the webpage using css. Is there a reason the soccer field picture was added via css, instead of html like the author’s avatar?

Images that are embedded in the HTML (IMG) are part of the content, per se. Search engines can index them so they contribute to SEO. CSS images are generally part of the skin of the page and not something we would consider as content worth indexing.
Background images are easy to maintain and update. We should be able to completely change the look of a page without ever having to touch the HTML. When considering where to place an image, ask yourself if this this visual (part of the skin) or if it relates to the content of the page.
An article about Brown Bears would very likely have an associated picture. That would be content. The fancy spruce bow border around the article would not be content, but window dressing (also skin) so CSS is where that image would be inserted.

In the HTML course, we learned about the benefits of structuring code using Semantic HTML. In this CSS course, I noticed the code still uses the standard HTML structure. Is it more difficult to integrate CSS styling into Semantic HTML code?
(Link to my current page: https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-css/lessons/css-visual-rules/exercises/css-visual-rules?action=resume_content_item)




 elambrose13:

Is it more difficult to integrate CSS styling into Semantic HTML code?


Not at all. CSS works for all of HTML, and does not treat semantic markup any differently, and neither should we. Both give structure to the content.

I have noticed something. Why were we told it is best practice to use semantic HTML such as     but in these CSS exercises and every other exercise, the examples only show 's with classes and ID’s?

Let’s say we have a list.
<ul>
<li>aluminum</li>
<li>molybdenum<ul>
  <li>Atomic number: 42</li>
  <li>Atomic mass: 95.95 u</li>
</ul></li>
<li>iron</li>
<li>zinc</li>
<li>tin</li>
<li>nickel</li>
<li>silver</li>
<li>gold</li>
<li>platinum<ul>
  <li>Atomic number: 78</li>
  <li>Atomic mass: 195.084 u</li>
</ul></li>
<li>lead</li>
</ul>

Now we would, upon completion and ordering of details, embark upon how we wish to style the components of this list. Ask yourself, ‘how much do I wish to pollute this document markup with any more detail?’
From a purely traversal standpoint, we can reach every element in the list, without using class or id. Few learners really take the time to learn this approach, which is why there is so scant information available. The person or persons who make this a more meaningful approach will definitely earn my praise. Pipe dream, one supposes. Everywhere one looks we find class and id.
That might be telling us something. The more complex a document becomes, the more hooks are needed to ensure that style application is uniform and as expected.
With so many use cases to explore, it’s impractical to focus on only one or a few. What we might focus on is a plan of action when traversal alone is not practical, or simple. The objective is to have as few selector rules as needs be and to maintain as low a specificity as possible throughout the cascade.
It is tiny rules of thumb like these that make explaining CSS a greater challenge than the language itself requires.

In the example code from “introduction to visual rules”, why were the sections of html categorized using <div> instead of semantic dividers previously taught?
Thank you.

That is a question we cannot answer. Markup is less of a science and more of an outline. We can write semantic markup using only the conventional elements provided our document follows an outline. The structure is what gives semantics.
The new elements introduced in HTML5 make it easier to define sections, and permit multiple topic bodies as a result. They are not a panacea, though. HTML is largely based on the same recommendations as before.
Bottom line, structure is just as important as it always has been.

why HTML code in lesson CSS Visual Rules NOT semantic

As stated earlier, HTML can be written semantically without using semantic elements. The structure holds much meaning.
At this stage of learning it is pointless to split hairs or get hung up on minor details. Keep an open mind and learn to write well structured markup that follows an outline.

How exactly was the figure’s caption postioned over of the image? I’ve attached the photo below:

image876×628 217 KB


The image is a CSS background-image, meaning there is no special trick except the use position to offset the text from the top.
top: 80%;

or something along that line. Check the CSS for .caption, and also for .image selector rules.

mtf,
Thank you! I have also found the following to help explain the position property 



MDN Web Docs



position
The position CSS property sets how an element is positioned in a document. The top, right, bottom, and left properties determine the final location of positioned elements.

I’ve a question:
One task 4 - Use the  grid-template-columns property to make the first column 200 pixels wide and the second column 400 pixels wide."" Why does this code impact those specific grid sections and not all of them?
.container {
display: grid;
max-width: 900px;
position: relative;
margin: auto;
grid-gap: 10px;
grid-template-areas:
“header header”
“nav nav”
“left right”
“footer footer”;
grid-template-columns:200px 400px;

I am guessing that there is some sort of column separation occurring in the Header, nav and Footer sections. However, since those sections have been styled the same between the two columns, we are unable to see the differing column width values.

what is the difference between   and .
and why doweuse 

can you explain the elements   

Is it possible to consolidate grid-template-rows, grid-template-columns, and grid-template-areas into just grid-template?

In style.css:
.container {
[…]
margin: auto
[…]
Why is the grid not centered when we expand the browser window?

If I’m understanding the question correctly,
“header header” = (header)200px + (header)400px = 600px
“nav nav” = (nav)200px + (nav)400px = 600px
“left right” = (left)200px + (right)400px = 600px
“footer footer” = (footer)200px + (footer)400px = 600px
so grid-template-columns did work on all of them (everything grid-template related)

this section feels so daunting. They just throw an entire wall of text at you and don’t bother explaining every step. I feel like this lesson could benefit from being separated into smaller parts.

I concur!!!  It starts with a great steady explaining/learning pace to, what seems, somebody got bored writing this section or trying to explain things -then started dryly just throwing all the information out there at once…leaving user/learner struggling to piece it all together.
Meaning Codecademy is missing the point on this one. Not actually teaching (helping) they have essentially turned into a monotonous, dull, tedious, collegiate textbook that is simply throwing information out there without considering helpful means of explanation abandoning all thoughtful/creative techniques of information sharing.  With no understanding that  a ton of information was just put out there that randomly pulls from some areas and that all points seem to do the exact same thing… but not explaining/showing the gradual contextual build up.
Again, leaving the user to try and pull it together.  And a collegiate textbook comes with a teacher…this has extremely poor guidance and zero explanation.  Would never suggest this section to anyone looking to learn CSS.  Book for Dummies would be a better source than this random toss-out of a poorly designed course…

Same Here. I am so confused and frustrated with this chapter I just stopped. Without explanations why do they have them doubled all of a sudden like “header header” “nav nav” etc…?
Then how am I suppose to figure what value to put on the rows and columns to get it right?

Highly recommend anybody struggling with the example code put it into .html and .css files and look at the results. The visual was hugely helpful when the wall of text didn’t do it for me.
HTML file:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

<link href=""./test.css"" type=""text/css"" rel=""stylesheet"">

<!--TESTING SPACE-->

<div class=""container"">
  <header>Welcome!</header>
  <nav>Links!</nav>
  <section class=""info"">Info!</section>
  <section class=""services"">Services!</section>
  <footer>Contact us!</footer>
</div>

<!--TESTING SPACE-->

</html>

CSS file:
.container {
  display: grid;
  max-width: 900px;
  position: relative;
  margin: auto;
  grid-template-areas: ""head head""
                       ""nav nav"" 
                       ""info services""
                       ""footer footer"";
  grid-template-rows: 300px 120px 800px 120px;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 3fr; 
}

header {
  grid-area: head;
	background-color: red;
} 

nav {
  grid-area: nav;
	background-color: orange;
} 

.info {
  grid-area: info;
	background-color: yellow;
} 

.services {
  grid-area: services;
	background-color: green;
}

footer {
  grid-area: footer;
	background-color: blue;
}

I added background colours to each of the other CSS rules to help visualize everything and it ended up looking like this (zoomed out to get it all in one screenshot):

Also came very close to submitting a bug report because the first instruction wasn’t accepting my answer where I was putting in “head” instead of “header” since that’s what had been written in the example, in case anyone is also experiencing the same oversight!

This has not nearly enough explanation, the missing information is that the declaration of a new string creates a new row, and the individual letters or space-separated words within those strings represents columns. That was not explained or explained very well. Codecademy has a habit of giving the same level of explanation to easy things as hard things. For example, Typography was 19 lessons and the box model  which is muchhhh more difficult to understand and gets much less explaining. The grid stuff up until this point had the same level of explanation but this thing is much more complex, its the very first time I haven’t intuitively understood the idea they were presenting.

I had to go to W3 Schools and get it explained for me to get past this roadblock

hi, I was trying to define the columns and rows using shorthand grid-template and it doesn’t seem to work with grid-templates-areas.
.container {
  display: grid;
  max-width: 900px;
  position: relative;
  margin: auto;
  grid-gap: 10px;
  grid-template-areas: ""header header""
  ""nav nav""
""left right""
""footer footer"";
// grid-template-columns: 200px 400px;
// grid-template-rows: 150px 200px 600px 200px;
grid-template: 150px 200px 600px 200px / 200px 400px;
}

and the layout is broken, this is the result:
image1193×840 7.97 KB
Couldn’t find any explanation for this, maybe somebody here knows…

Hi,
why if I am refactoring code to grid -template I am not getting the same result as I would in separating columns and rows?
Thank you for your help!
.container {
display: grid;
max-width: 900px;
position: relative;
margin: auto;
grid-gap: 10px;
grid-template-areas:
“header header”
“nav nav”
“left right”
“footer footer”;
grid-template: 150px 200px 600px 200px / 200px 400px;
}
h1, h2 {
font-family: monospace;
text-align: center;
}
header {
background-color: dodgerblue;
grid-area: header;
}
nav {
background-color: beige;
grid-area: nav;
}
.left {
background-color: dodgerblue;
grid-area: left;
}
.right {
background-color: beige;
grid-area: right;
}
footer {
background-color: dodgerblue;
grid-area: footer;
}

true, same “problem” here

the section asking you to do this:
grid-template-areas: “head head”
“nav nav”
“info services”
“footer footer”;
IS NOT EXPLAINED AT ALL!
my questions:
what the heck is the correct syntax for this?
is the spacing important? is it tabs, spaces… what?
why are we simply typing the same word twice with a space between? what does that ever do? Codecademy a little more context please?
I have typed it EXACTLY as the solution gives after resetting my code and it doesn’t accept it. I even copied and pasted the solution code and without the specifications it doesn’t let you proceed… yet it doesn’t have you put in the specifications until after this first step of typing:
grid-template-areas: “head head”
“nav nav”
“info services”
“footer footer”;


I input this code and it worked. I thought the lesson was great in telling you what to type; however, it did not explain why. I would really like to know why the sections are in there twice. Any help would be appreciated!


what the heck is the correct syntax for this?
is the spacing important? is it tabs, spaces… what?

The correct syntax is one space between each class.
Even if you specify 2 identical classes.
So if you have the classes “header” and “item” in the same row, taking one column each, the syntax would be:
grid-template-areas: ""header item""
And if you have ONLY the class “header” and you want it to take two columns, the syntax would be:
grid-template-areas: ""header header""

why are we simply typing the same word twice with a space between? what does that ever do?

Simply put, the grid-template-areas property allows you to create a layout for your grid, straight from the grid container. It replaces the annoying grid-row/column-start/end property that you were required to specify for each grid item separately.
Now, breath deep, clear your mind, and remember this when you think of grid-template-areas:
The horizontal line with the most classes will define how many columns you have.
The amount of lines with classes specified will define how many rows you have.


I have typed it EXACTLY as the solution gives after resetting my code and it doesn’t accept it.

That’s because Codecademy has a mistake in their example.
It’s not grid-template-areas: ""head head"" but rather grid-template-areas: ""header header"" because the class name is not head, but header.
When you specify the classes names, you need to specify the exact class name as it appears inside the HTML.
Hope this helped!

In this example, why did the .question divs “bump” into the .answer divs in the first place? If div is a block-level element by default, and we didn’t specify any display properties for div or .question (we only specified display: inline-block for .answer divs, of which .question is the parent element), then wouldn’t each new .question div start on a new line by default?
html would be .question container element, so wouldn’t .question always span the entire width of html?

I think it’s because the <div>s with class=""question"" are parent elements not just to the <h4> and <h2> elements which form the questions (question header and question text, respectively), but also to the <div>s with class=""answer"".
Having read @mtf’s post from the previous exercise and also https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/float, I’ve realised the following:
The declaration float: left;, as well as sending an element to the left of the space its parent occupies, also makes the other elements within that same parent (effectively its “brothers and sisters”) wrap/float around it. I think this is the “bumping into” action that the lesson describes, which we can then counteract by using the clear property.
I found the visual examples given in the demo at the top of https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/float particularly helpful in grasping how the neighbouring elements interact when the float property is used to style one/some of them i.e. there is a knock-on effect and all of them are affected.
In my humble opinion, I don’t think exercises 10 and 11 (Float and Clear) of this lesson are particularly helpful in how they explain what is actually happening when we use the float property, and I think the examples could be much clearer. I was particularly confused until I read @mtf’s post and the MDN web doc (both of which I’ve linked to above).
I hope that helps!  …and that some of the experts/moderators will chip in with any further clarification, correction, or confirmation of this.

Agreed – why was float introduced to us in a lesson where it does nothing but make a shambles of the demo page?
Wouldn’t it make more sense to teach us float in the context of a demo page where it was actually necessary? E.G. An author’s picture floated to the left of the text of an article they wrote.

Thank you jon_morris! Your post (particularly the link to the MDN article with the interactive example) was THE thing I needed to understand this. I agree the exercises on this site were not exactly the clearest at explaining the float concept.
The key takeaway I got from this is that a div is block level by default, but using a float makes it in-line, so other elements (if they fit) can ‘wrap around’ them.
For anyone who is having trouble, I highly recommend the interactive example on the MDN page!




 gxcad:

but using a float makes it in-line, so other elements (if they fit) can ‘wrap around’ them.


I checked https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/float, and I don’t think that using the float property makes a default block-level element inline. As you can see from the text and table just below the demo at the top, float uses a block layout, and actually computes inline and inline-block elements as block-level elements. I think the key here is setting the width of our block-level elements to less than the full width of the page, and then “floating” them. Any other elements within the same parent will then wrap around them (“if they fit”, as you say).
What do you think? 
Glad the link and interactive example helped!  

Yes, I think your explanation is more accurate than mine. They are block, but behave like chunks of inline in the sense that more than one block can fit in one line (if they fit…lol).

I find it funny how in the end after learning float and clear, they’re like “oh and on second thought, remove these.” Very clever, Codecademy, very clever. 

Why I can’t combine position: absolute or fixed and float property?
When I combine position: absolute/fixed and float happens this:

But when I put position: static/relative and float, the float works well:

Hi,
clear:left; in the .question selector fixed the problem of Question bumping into the answers of Question 1.
But when I go to the .answer selector and apply clear:right; it does not do the same thing.
Why is that?

I don’t know…I think the only point of this lesson was to intentionally mess up a web-page then walk the student through un-messing it up via CSS so that the student could learn interactively how the CSS applies visually to actual ‘content’ displayed in the viewport/webpage. In the end, the unnecassary top most element was still a mess. I re-wrote the CSS to make it not cover up the stuff below it when the user/visitor opened it their browser just to tidy it up before I moved on my with my educational experience here at Codecademy. I did learn how those annoying advertisements and click-bait videos that appear on various web-sites get put in my face to close so I can get to the content/information I was looking for in the first place got there. That was educational.

My question exactly!

div {
  width: 200px;
  float: left;
}

div.special {
  clear: left;
}

“In the example above, all <div> s on the page are floated to the left side. The element with class special did not move all the way to the left because a taller <div> blocked its positioning. By setting its clear property to left , the special <div> will be moved all the way to the left side of the page.”
That’s from the description of exercise 11. What does it mean that an element is taller? The wording is just so confusing - so the element moves, but then it doesn’t, but really it does?

if i have 4 elements and  i added  !important style to one  element. will the !important  apply to every  elemnts

This question keeps popping up and I strongly suspect it’s because a lesson author didn’t give it much thought and included the subject way too early in the introduction to CSS, long before learners understand anything about the cascade, specificity, inheritence and importance. It should not come up until near the end of any CSS course.
A naive learner will see !important as some kind of magic bullet that solves all their problems. They would be categorically incorrect in that notion. It doesn’t solve problems, it creates them.
In answer to the question, if all the elements are of the same type, regardless how they are classed or identified, the selector rule with !important will trump them all.
An earlier topic on this subject asks roughly the same question and to that was given an HTML/CSS example to demonstrate the omnipotence of !important. It should be easy to find that topic, and when you do, study the example closely by copying it to your computer and running it. It’s a clear case of a picture being a thousand words.

can !important override another !important with a different rule?


This exercise talks about making our CSS more flexible. What does this mean and how can we accomplish this?

Use that model to add an !important modifier on the #h5 selector rule. What is the result?

Later…
      h5  {
        color: black !important;
      }
      h5 {
        color: red;
      }
      .h5  {
        color: blue;
      }
      #h5  {
        color: green !important;
      }

Output



https://repl.it/@mtf/important-specificity

Of course this is ludicrous. We would never code CSS to this extreme, but since we’re just playing…
Remove the modifier and see what happens.

Why hasn’t !important been deprecated out of W3C standards as of HTML5 if there’s no real reason to use it in the first place?
On a side note, “naive” is a pejorative.  Pretty sure that’s against Codecademy policy, sir.

I would support Roy’s use of the term naïve here.

1: (of a person or action) showing a lack of experience, wisdom, or judgment.
2: (of a person) natural and unaffected; innocent.

That is descriptive and accurate with what Roy was conveying, which was helpful advice.

Much appreciated on the second set of eyes, @oduffy, too much YouTube can wreak havoc on one’s mental state.  I’m still curious as to why !important hasn’t been deprecated yet as of HTML5, if there’s almost no need to ever use it.
Back to work for this naive coder…




 cyberluddite:

I’m still curious as to why !important hasn’t been deprecated yet as of HTML5, if there’s almost no need to ever use it.


That is a really good question. Let’s take a look at the latest CSS specification:

CSS attempts to create a balance of power between author and user style sheets. By default, rules in an author’s style sheet override those in a user’s style sheet, which override those in the user-agent’s default style sheet. To balance this, a declaration can be made important, which increases its weight in the cascade and inverts the order of precedence.


An important declaration takes precedence over a normal declaration. Author and user style sheets may contain !important declarations, with user !important declarations overriding author !important declarations. This CSS feature improves accessibility of documents by giving users with special requirements (large fonts, color combinations, etc.) control over presentation.

!important is a very useful tool in the context it was meant to be used - in user style sheets. As a developer, you have full control over agent style sheets - there is no need to use !important.
It is a bad practice to use !important in agent style sheets and this is clearly stated by the CSS specification.
!important breaks the natural flow of precedence and specificity. It might help you solve your problem quickly, but this will lead to other problems in the future. !important is meant to be used in the user style sheets.

Sometimes we don’t have full control over the agent style sheets. Sometimes we have to work with a 3rd party library which we cannot modify or we have to deal with an API which returns markup code with inline styles applied.
This is where the use of !important is justified and it might even be the best solution in terms of the maintenance of the codebase. But this happens rarely.

@factoradic
Thanks, that’s a pretty cool workaround.  I can see why it came with a warning label during the lesson. 

You’re very welcome 

Can someone explain the difference between
h2.destination 

destination.h2

How do I know when to use either or?

for some reason I am  progressing in the lesson, but none of my code is affecting the learning space.
anyone have a reason why?

What is the difference between specificity selector and chaining selector

There is no such thing as a specificity selector. All selectors have specificity.
Chaining is done with class and id selectors, usually class.

What is the difference between using ‘space-between’ in justify-content, and just setting up grid-gaps when setting the grid template?

As far as I can understand, the “space-between” value will distribute the space between the gaps evenly to fit 100% of the grid container. Assigning “grid-gap” properties could result in an overflow (depending on how large the values are) so content might go out from the container area.
Hope that helps.

Does using “stretch” give the same result as “start” always or that is only obtainable in this exercise. Thanks.

In which situation do I prefer which method to modifiy and add new fonts - link method or @font-face method?

Good Question
I just completed Font Face III, I felt it was glossed over quickly. The syntax wasn’t explained. There is like 3 or 4 different ways to link fonts in. Each  syntax is completely different.

https://fonts.googleapis.com/css
Then, add the  family=  URL parameter, with one or more font family names and styles.
For example, to request the [Inconsolata]  font:
https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Inconsolata

Hi Tom
Thanks for that I kind of went through the video, which are very helpful in getting the answers, but I appreciate your help.

Hi, I am stuck with how to load the css/latin rules.
I did exactly as they said and pasted the link in the browser but no latin rules come up.
Please help!

Generally you should just link the rel in the html document for optimization of page rendering.

did you figure it out? this is the first time ive been stuck on the htm/css course, i feel like maybe the instructions are outdated or something.

how to apply font to particular section using @font-face property?

Can you merge multiple fonts from the same font-family, when using @font-face?
For example:
@font-face ‘font xyz’
bold,
italic,
regular
Instead of writing 3 separate font-face codes for bold, italic, regular  respectively?

i have a question , what is non-user fonts and give some examples?

The instructions on this sections give us a grid area code that says:
.item {
grid-area: 2 / 3 / 4 / span 5;
}
Then tells us that the following will have the columns spanning from “3 to 8”. If the logic in the section before is correct, then would it not span from “3 to 7”? Could you help me if I’m mistaken? Thanks!

I am also confused by this.

What I think is going on here - this is an example - is that like in a few exercises before this one when we were using grid-row-start and grid-row-end, we had to enter the row (or column) # one after where we actually wanted it to end. So for example:
.item {
grid-row-start: 4;
grid-row-end: 6;
}
…would span the item 2 rows (4 and 5). So we could refactor this code to be:
.item {
grid-row: 4 / span 2;
}
So now if we think about this current exercise using that same reasoning, when they say the column spans from 3 to 8, I think they are speaking of 8 as the column where the item ends, but does not actually take up column 8, it only spans the 5 columns of 3,4,5,6,7.

I too was stumped on this. I did not understand where it mentions in the directions of where span 3 and then 1 would be added?
From what I interpreted the directions give:
In  style.css , create a rule set for class  c . Use  grid-area  to make this item take up the eighth column and rows six, seven and eight. Use  span  for both ending values.
I thought it was meant to be interpreted as: grid-area: 6 / 7 / span 8;
Or did I miss something?

I think you answered my question and I am just reading this
:woman_facepalming.
Thank you.

In the example its states-
.item {
grid-area: 2/3/4/span 5;
}
…then explains that the item will “occupy” 3 through 8, so if its actually “occupying” those columns then I could read that to be
.item {
grid-column-start: 3;
grid-column-end: 9;
}
. Which leads me to believe they are not counting column 3 as one of the 5 being spanned (4,5,6,7,8 are the 5 spanned).
Now, in Instruction # 2 they are clearly including row 6 as one of the 3 spanned. It states “…this item take up the eighth column and rows six, seven, and eight.”
.c {
grid-area: 6 / 8 / span 3 / span 1;
}
So, if I were to read this as it was explained in the exercise I would start counting the 3 spanned at 7 (7,8,9). Which could also be read as:
.c {
grid-row-start: 6;
grid-row-end: 10;
}
I do still think it is confusing as to where you’re suppose to start counting the span from, the column/row it start from, or the column/row immediately following the starting point??? After reviewing the prior exercise #13. Grid Column…When counting the spans, you start counting at the starting column/row.

Adding to the discussion about how grid layout work in CSS in case of looking for an interactive the below link can help a lot.
https://grid.layoutit.com/

I would say not to worry about it too much. I’ve come to find out doing the exercises, when you look at the results of your css, and you see it’s not exactly where it should be, either a little too far right, or down etc. Then you know where to go and change the number to one more or one less (or larger difference if necessary).

im massively confused by the whole grid chapters. I feel like something is missing from it.

Try working it out on graph paper with a pencil first. Number your rows and columns.

I am in the same situation as you, i aslo thought it was: grid-area: 6 / 7 / span 8;
but there is the red writing that tells me “This item should start in column 8”.
And I don’t understand it, can someone help plsss?

grid-area takes four values separated by / in the format:
grid-area: grid-row-start / grid-column-start / grid-row-end / grid-column end;
The instructions for the exercise state: Use grid-area to make this item take up the eighth column and rows six, seven and eight. Use span for both ending values.
Understanding of the instruction: The item (div with class=“box c”) should take up the Eighth column. Just one column. The eighth one. The second part of the instruction states “rows six, seven and eight”. So, the item should occupy these three rows.
Translating the above understanding into numbers means: the grid-row-start value should be “6”. The grid-row-end value should be “span 3” so that three rows (6, 7, 8) are occupied by the item. The grid-column-start value should be “8” because we want the item to occupy column 8. The grid-column-end value should be “span 1” which means the item should only occupy column 8.
Putting these numbers into the correct order gives us:
grid-area: grid-row-start / grid-column-start / grid-row-end / grid-column end;
grid-area: 6 / 8 / span 3 / span 1;

This is probably a dumb question, but is the repeat() function only compatible with grid-template-columns and grid-template-rows?
The reason I ask is because when I reached part 3 of the instructions (where we are asked to refactor the CSS code for the .a selector to use grid-area), I used repeat(), presuming it can be used universally within CSS syntax. In other words, I wrote:
.a {
  grid-area: 5 / 1 repeat(2, / span 2);
}

which didn’t work, whereas
.a {
  grid-area: 5 / 1 / span 2 / span 2;
}

worked just fine.
Of course, in this case using repeat() would obviously not be any more practical than manually repeating  / span 2. However, since I instinctively used repeat() without giving it much thought, I am just curious about the contextual limitations of repeat() in CSS code.


While I am not entirely sure, the documentation for the repeat function (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/repeat) does seem to suggest that it is specific to these two.

This function can be used in the CSS Grid properties grid-template-columns and grid-template-rows.


thats exactly how i wrote it and im still getting it wrong . any idea why?Screenshot from 2020-07-01 04-13-14813×180 23.6 KB

What feedback message is displaying at the bottom of the page? Sometimes, the feedback can help figure out the issue. Maybe, try deleting the extra space before the closing semicolon.

it is like this
gird-area:(x,y,width for row, width for column)

Hi !
I just finished this chapter and even if it’s seems ok on a theorical point of view, I tried some test on my own with my code editor and it""s quite confusing especially with the grid-row and grid-column.
Are we agree that :
grid-row : 4 / span 6 ;
It will start the box line 4 of the container ==> and will ended line 10 ?
grid column: 2 / span 2;
will start column n° 2 and will ended N°4 ?
Of course depending of the grid-template value on the container, the height and size will be different ?
Thanks!

Can we use publish_time instead of publish-time for a selector in CSS? Is it Mandatory to use publish-time

‘‘Classes can be reusable, while IDs can only be used once.’’
i dont understand this

There may be 30 students in a classroom, but each have a unique id, else how would we know who’s grade it is posted on the exam board. There are no names on the list, only numbers, and only the student knows their own number (besides the examiner).
An ID is very specific, and pertains to just one thing. It can be small or it can be large, but it is most definitely singular. There can be only one.
Classes on the other hand are nebulous and ubiquitous. They are everywhere and can pertain to all manner of objects. That’s why they are re-usable.

Is it possible to create a selector chain with an id included?
e.g. #myid, .class {
color: teal;
}
also, is there a limit to how many selectors can be included in a chain?

What you have there is not a chain, but a selector list. Each selector is treated independently.
A chain would result in a single selector.
#myid.class {}

That selector will target only the id=""myid"" class=""class"" element. It would be rather moot, though, since the id is so unique and specific.
Now if we used a descendant selector,
#myid .class

Then only those child elements of #myid with the class, class would be targeted.

What’s the significance (if any) of the different colours in code in CSS?

If you are referring to the letter color in the editor, that is called syntax highlighting and helps to distinguish different aspects of the code. Once we get used to what colors appear, we can spot errors when the colors don’t seem right. Things like missing quotes or missing curly braces, or other syntax errors are usually the problem. Highlighting helps us zero in on errors.

Is there any “convention” about ordering all the styles in my CSS sheet? In terms of order and clarity code, is there any rule or advice?
(I assume that the hierarchy in styles is defined by the specificity (covered in chapters 11, 14 and 15 of this lesson) and the order as they appear in CSS sheet doesn’t matter)
Thank you!




 core7060940846:

ordering all the styles in my CSS sheet?


Yes, most definitely. Selector rules can be overridden by rules that appear later in the style sheet’s written order. This is a fundamental concept in CSS and well worth taking the time to explore further, imho.

Take for example the anchor element, which has pseudo-class selectors in its repertoire.
a {}
a:link {}
a:visited {}
a:hover {}
a:focus {}
a:active {}

The order in which we write these selectors will have a definite bearing on whether they have any influence, let alone the affect we expect. We’re going to use all of them, so best get the order that we can expect the best result from, which is the above. Mind, we can switch :hover and :focus around since they are independent.
If these pseudo-classes are foreign, then do read up on them. It’s a brief learning opportunity that won’t take much of your time and will still in your lexicon for all time.
Briefly, I’ve defined the generic selector first so it has least specificity. However, I give it all the properties relating to style so it becomes the basic template for that element. :link let’s me define things like color and text-decoration; :visited let’s me override the color and/or text-decoration (for instance why underline a link we’ve already visited, a visual clue without even changing color, though color is a better one); :hover and :focus are reason again to change color and/or outline (default for focus) and/or background, border, etc. We should not change font-size or font-weight since that causes jumping motion that is disturbing to some users. Ditto with alignment. Color change and text-decoration are the best signals to give the user.
:active is for when the user has depressed the mouse button or a keyboard user has pressed ‘Enter’. We can leave the link in view with a different color to give a signal of, ‘this is where we are.’
In order for any of this to work we need the written order as suggested above.
Now back to the OP,  it is strongly advisable to dig into CSS just as a read, without clacking any keys. Just read, reason, reread, and store it away. Once turning to practical usage a lot more will make sense in a viable way. Read, read, read.
Learn why we write selector rules with the least specificity possible. I almost challenge one to do that just for the exercise. CSS is so beautiful, and so pliable. There is good reason it has been a spec for decades past, and is certain to be in good stead for decades to come. Learn the whys and wherefores of this bold statement. Then you begin to understand CSS and take command of it. It is, after all a declarative language, not an imperative one.

Actually, post Level II all elements have one pseudo-class, :hover. We can hover on any element, not just a link.

Hello MTF and thank you very, very much!



 mtf:

Selector rules can be overridden by rules that appear later in the style sheet’s written order.


I appreciate a lot all your explanation, I didn’t know that the order in a CSS matters. Is that “override by order behaviour”  depending of the specificity? I assume that if it appears a more specific rule after a less one, it will compute the specificiest, not the latest. Is it correctly?
I think it’s better if I ask you by this example…
<!-- In html file -->
<p>Vivamus sit amet euismod tellus. Etiam eu diam vehicula, ultrices magna et, aliquet quam. </p>
<p class=""highlightInfo"">Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. In ac elit in lorem luctus pulvinar. Phasellus vulputate felis ut nisl vehicula sollicitudin eget vel purus.</p>
<p>Aliquam in diam sodales, egestas massa vel, auctor neque. Integer dolor odio, lobortis nec sagittis ut, bibendum ac felis.</p>

/* In css file (in this order!) */

.highlightInfo{
    background-color: darkgray;
    color: white;
    font-weight: bold;
}
    
p{
    background-color: lightgray;
}

In this example, in my 1st and 3rd paragraf it will compute p{} rule and the second on will compute the rule .highlightInfo{}. This is because his specificity and doesn’t matter the order of the rules in the css file. So… what you told me about being carefully about ordering is only when the rules are same specificity, isn’t it?
Assuming all of that, I still have doubts about ordering…
MY QUESTION: Which is the best way yo order all my rules in the CSS file?
I’ve seen some examples where they describe first the tag rules, then the classes and at the end the id rules. Or it’s a better idea to order alphabetically? Or you just go adding them one after another while you need to describe them?
Thank you very much!!!

Related with all of this, I’ve found this interesting article: The Definitive Guide to CSS Styling Order




 core7060940846:

what you told me about being carefully about ordering is only when the rules are same specificity, isn’t it?


Correct. Higher specificity trumps order. Same specificity is trumped by order.



 core7060940846:

Which is the best way yo order all my rules in the CSS file?


Specificity aside, the best order is the one that is easiest to maintain and read. I like to work from least to highest specificity, so type, pseudo-type, type combinator, class, pseudo-class, id. However, it is up to you.

What if I use same css style twice?
For example,
p {
font-family: Arial;
}
p{
font-family: Georgia;
}
Then, what would p look like?




 data7028470368:

what would p look like?


It would look the same as if the two properties were combined into one selector rule. We need to take care that we don’t write CSS like above else it will be difficult to maintain.

Thank you, so the font would appear as Georgia(because it is written later)?

Yes. As these two CSS rules have the same specificity, the one closest to the bottom will get applied

i dont understand the pixels

What about pixels do you not understand?
Pixels are a unit of measurement in CSS, just like inches or centimeters would be to us. A pixel on a user’s screen is one tiny dot of light. If you are setting a border to be a certain amount of pixels (px) wide, you are telling it to have a width that fills that many “pixels” on the user’s screen.

Does it matter the order of the properties in the border rule? :shaka:

If you put all the properties separately, it doesn’t matter:
border-width: 12px;
border-color: #000;
border-style: solid;

If you combine them into one border property, the order does matter. It must be width, then style, then color:
border: 1px dotted blue;


I put them in a different order and it still translated correctly - style, color, width

Is anyone else wondering why you have to paste the CSS rules TWICE?? Where does it mention to do that???

Each rule refers to one font weight. The lesson says to include normal (400) and bold (700) font weights, so there are two rules. You can see the different font-weight values in each rule.

Fair enough.  So then why would posting the exact same code twice make any difference?  I’m going out on a limb here to assume that I would need to have one code with the font-weight at 400 and one at 700?

@dacarrot24, @devlukasiewicz



 dacarrot24:

I’m going out on a limb here to assume that I would need to have one code with the font-weight at 400 and one at 700?


That’s exactly what you do have.
You’re not posting the exact same code  twice. The two latin @font-face rule sets look pretty much the same, but if you look at the font-weight and src properties, you’ll see that one is for 400/regular, and the other is for 700/bold.  

What are the pros and cons of using @font-face in CSS versus linking to a font in HTML?

There may still be some browsers out there that do not support this feature so some fallback may be required to substitute in a font via the <link> element in the HEAD or using a web-safe font we can expect to be on the user’s machine.
Depending on internet connection and download speed, the default font will be drawn in by the browser while it waits for the CSS font to come down. This can be unsettling for some.
Like all new and cutting edge developments, it takes time for universal adoption, sometimes years, so we should consider our audience’s needs before our own desire to be out front with new technologies.

Thanks for answering, Roy.  It sounds like a service mindset is useful for a web developer to have.




 mark_in_to:

Exactly. Responsive design isn’t just about adaptability and cross browser reliability, it’s also about responding to users’ needs, responsibly.

When I try to look up the code for Space Mono in the font-face 2 module on google fonts, it is saying this font doesn’t exist… what am i doing wrong?
The URL i used is:
https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=space+mono:400,700
and I’m getting the below as a result:
Error (400): Missing font family
The requested font families are not available.
Requested: space mono (style: normal, weight: 400),space mono (style: normal, weight: 700)


https://fonts.google.com/?query=space


@font-face {
font-family: ‘Space Mono’;
font-style: normal;
font-weight: 700;
src: local(‘Space Mono Bold’), local(‘SpaceMono-Bold’), url(https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/spacemono/v4/i7dMIFZifjKcF5UAWdDRaPpZUFWaHg.woff2) format(‘woff2’);

}
My question is: Is the “Unicode range” and the “URL” necessary when copying and pasting in the @font-property?

The URL is necessary since that’s where the font is being downloaded from. As for the Unicode range, I would think it would apply on a case by case basis, but cannot give a definitive answer to that. We see above that apart from the first 256 characters (of which only the first 128 are ASCII) the range includes special characters, which if one has the time could be further investigated.

So you would say its not necessary in all cases to include the Unicode range right?

Without further investigation there is no definitive answer to that question. I cannot agree with something about which I am not sure myself. Perhaps there is an answer on CSS Tricks, or elsewhere. I’m sure there must something in the specs to describe this more definitively. Until we have an answer, we should not assume anything.
The purpose of Unicode is to provide a character set that is applicable in any locale. How far your site reaches out to international audiences would be a determining factor as concerns implementing the special characters outside of the typical Latin character set. I’m afraid there is no one pat answer to this question.

why are we copying the @font-face two times in css ?

It says “If you need help retrieving the link for the appropriate font, click here.”,so I clicked here and copied this.
/* latin */
@font-face {
font-family: ‘Space Mono’;
font-style: normal;
font-weight: 400;
src: local(‘Space Mono’), local(‘SpaceMono-Regular’), url(https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/spacemono/v4/i7dPIFZifjKcF5UAWdDRYEF8RQ.woff2) format(‘woff2’);
unicode-range: U+0000-00FF, U+0131, U+0152-0153, U+02BB-02BC, U+02C6, U+02DA, U+02DC, U+2000-206F, U+2074, U+20AC, U+2122, U+2191, U+2193, U+2212, U+2215, U+FEFF, U+FFFD;
}
I could not run. I noticed mine was a little different from the solution, but why?

Trying to paste the Font URL into my browser but I get the following message:
This site can’t be reached
fonts.googleapis.com ’s server IP address could not be found.

[Try running Windows Network Diagnostics](javascript:diagnoseErrors()).

DNS_PROBE_FINISHED_NXDOMAIN
It doesn’t work, even when I use the direct link given from the exercise. I don’t know what’s going on with my browser. The Google Fonts previews don’t even display on my browser either. Using Google Chrome.

One for font-weight normal (400).
The second for font-weight bold (700).

spent an annoying amount of time getting frustrated on this before I  figured this out



 ggeorgalas:

The lesson says to include normal (400) and bold (700) font weights, so there are two rules.

The only thing we’re changing on this exercise is the “display:inline-block;” under the #left, correct? I did that, but it kept telling me it was incorrect. Then I got the solution just to find it was the exact same thing I did?? Anyone else have this issue or maybe I’m missing something?

Exactly the same problem here.

Funny you just posted in this today. I’m having a problem with this one, too.
Same as graceypoo13 - finally went to the solution and it was what I already had. 

float: left;
also does the trick and gets recognized as correct.

I did both, float: left and inline-block, both were marked incorrect.
So, is changing to inline-block a BETTER solution than float left?

you can also use. position: absolute on the left element and position relative on the right.

I did position fixed on the left elem and position relative on the right and that worked…im not sure why. any idea?

In my browser, my “incorrect” solution looks closer to the target than the codecademy “solution”:

Note the white line between red and blue in the official solution.
I’m using safari

I have the exact same code as you, but mine keeps getting marked wrong!

Tried this too – still wrong. ???


@codecademy
I kept going with the correct code – Codecademy kept telling me it was wrong.
I revealed the solution and it matched my code EXACTLY.
This code challenge is challenged.

BUG REPORT: Entering the correct code does not allow us to pass. PLEASE FIX THIS.
Entering the correct answer and still does not pass even after a total cache dump and reseting the workspace. I am not allowed to view the test files, but obviously something needs adjustment.
I have compared the starting code and the “Answer” which allows me to continue. There is not so much as an extra line of code, extra space, or any number out of place.

same here. did anyone manage to resolve this issue or is this the end of the line in this web development course? i cannot move past this task.

revealing the solution did let me move on. i also sent a bug report, hopefully it will get fixed.

Had the exact same problem with display set to inline-block. I changed the browsers zoom from 110% to 100% and it worrked

This answer needs to be higher up, solved my issue.
Thx!

This happened to me too. I’m hoping if they see enough people mention it they’ll fix it for the people who come after us.

Isn’t the colorwheel used as an example missing saturation?
""If you imagine a line segment drawn from the center of the color wheel to the perimeter, the saturation is a point on that line segment. ""
There is no difference from the center to te perimeter in the circle given in the example

Confused me, too.
If anything, the colours look slightly more vivid in the centre, but only if I squint and then I’m probably imagining it. Hard to pick out any real difference from the edge to the centre.

Where I can get the HSL Color Wheel?

Can you use hsl in conjunction with hex, rgb or named colors?

Generally, it’s best to be consistent so that it’s much easier to read the colors. But in a way, yes, you could mix up hsl with hex, rgb, and named colors. Hope this helped!

If you mean by getting the chart that shows the colors, you can visit HSL Color Wheel

Easier to use and more applicable for a 4 color web page lay-out in my opinion.Color Picker.Another web-site where you can learn a bit about color theory and really see what different colors do to the appearance of a web-page Color Chooser. This second one gives you the ability to change the HSL then automatically tells you what the HEX equivalent is. I like it.

how do you finish the last question?

Elements can be hidden from view with the visibility property. Why would someone choose to hide an element? If I don’t want it to be shown, shouldn’t I use the block comment /* instead?

Much of what we access on the web today is dynamic in nature, that means immediate change in view occurs with every listened for event. Take for instance a menu that is out of sight until the user hovers on a hamburger icon, then pops into view.
Mind, this would not be a use for visibility but display. The latter takes the object completely out of normal flow, the former does not.
visibility applies to a defined object and does not alter its position in normal flow. If it has dimensions, it will take up space, whether visible or hidden. Where this comes into play is when we have a defined layout and we don’t want it jumping around, but stable, with everything maintaining its position.
Say for instance our code displays messages at various intervals or upon given events and outcomes that we don’t want to display for very long. Popping in a message will cause the lines below that point to shift in order to make room for the message to fit in. visibility protects the real estate that message needs to display. When the message is gone, the space remains, but is unoccupied.
function timeOut(el) {
  setTimeout(() => {
    el.textContent = '';
  }, 2000);
};

The above nulls out a string, but also causes the line it was written on to also drop out. Content below jumps up.
function timeOut(el) {
  el.style.visibility = 'visible';
  setTimeout(() => {
    el.style.visibility = 'hidden';
  }, 2000);
};

will hide the textContent but will not give up the line. Mind, we can still collapse if we so desire. In either case, we do not manipulate the textContent. It gets set elsewhere.

When using the padding property in CSS: if you can write out all the values for padding in one line of code, is there ever a reason to use the other properties like padding-top or padding-right?

From what I understand, the best method of writing the margin or padding in CSS is to use the shorthand “padding” rather than “padding-left”, “padding-right”, and so on. The shorthand only takes one line of space and is easily understood by anyone reading the code.
The article on W3 has more information about the shorthand, and only briefly mentions the more defined properties. https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_padding.asp

My question here is whether it is best practice to write out all four options of padding or margins when using the shorthand “padding” property. I remember reading elsewhere that it is best practice to explicitly state all values in a property even if they are remaining a default so that the code is easier to read and maintain.
Not sure if this applies in this situation however, since technically writing out padding: 10px 20px; is exactly the same as writing padding: 10px 20px 10px 20px;.

If line-height is defined in code by a ratio e.g line-height:1.4; as in the exercise. Which digit represent the lead and which the font-size?

The lead isn’t explicitly specified, but I guess you can split the line-height of 1.4 into  1 + 0.4 and interpret it as 1 times the font height for the actual font and an additional 0.4 times for the lead.

It says that triadic schemes use colors that are equidistant from each other on the color wheel, and then incorrectly lists 3 colors that are not equidistant on the color wheel:
""For instance, if we stick with blue being our main color, we would then select red-orange and yellow-green as the pairing combinations. ""
That should be violet or purple-blue rather than blue, correct?
