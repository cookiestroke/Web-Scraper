I have completed the full Chatbot course. However, I still have the open question, how can I create several categories within the answers in the retrieval based chatbot?
As an example: In the retrieval based chatbot project “Cyborg Cantina”, a category “food” exists as variable “blank_spot”. How can I extend the bot now so that further categories are added? E.g. “opening hours”, “table reservation” etc.?
If I understand it correctly, the bot Cyborg Cantina is for example limited to questions about food at the moment. I would like to extend this to more categories.

I must say that I am quite disappointed not to get any help. It’s a pity, I had hoped for more and can do so little with the course contents. No officals here to help??

I’m having trouble validating this exercise, as well. I had to go to the solution code to get through step 3.
After resetting the workspace, I copy-pasted the solution code and still could not validate step 3; the error “Expected .generate_response() to be called” persists, as can be seen in the attached screenshot.

I wasn’t able to pass through this exercise without going to the solution code. Step 2 calls for the word2vec model to be named both word2vec() AND word2vec_model() simultaneously.

Call  word2vec()  on the string  ""clothes""  and assign the result to  category .
Call  word2vec_model()  on the concatenated form of  message_nouns  and assign the result to  tokens .

When you opt for the solution code, you’ll see that the model in the provided code has been renamed word2vec(). I reset the entire exercise, then used the copy-pasted solution code, and was still unable to validate Step 2.

Hi there, welcome to the forums.
It’s because Python is an interpreted language, so when you run your program Python executes it line-by-line, top to bottom.
In your code, by the time you get to doing
if res == 'c':
    return order_latte()

you haven’t yet declared the function order_latte(), so Python doesn’t know what you mean. 
Also, I formatted your code correctly so we can see the indenting. Please read this thread to see how to do this for future questions. (It makes it a lot easier for us to help you, especially with Python!  )

great thank you for help 

tries to declare caffe_latte () before it appears in the get_drink_type () function, however, despite all attempts, NameError messages still appear. Could you show me exactly what it should look like? I will be very grateful.

You should be able to simply move the entire order_latte function above get_drink_type and it should work. (At least, it did when I tried that in a repl…) 

You don’t declare things.
When you execute a def statement, you create a function and assign that name to it, it is an action carried out.
So you would create all the functions you need, then invoke them. Doesn’t matter what order they are created in, you just need to create them before you end up calling them.
def a():
    b()

def b():
  return 0

a()  # a and b both exist at this time

Hi - in this exercise the negative_responses and exit_commands attributes come before def init(self):, whereas the class variable matching_phrases comes afterwords. I am not fully understanding the distinction between an attribute coming before  def init(self): and variable coming after.  What is the difference in behaviour? The fact that both attribute and class variable are accessed within the instance by self. prefix adds to my confusion. Any clarification on this would be greatly appreciated.
