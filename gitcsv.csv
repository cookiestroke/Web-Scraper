Hi all. Trying to get on with the part of the course every time I click it says:
Something has gone wrong
We’re sorry, and we are working our best to fix this. In the meantime, have you tried the following?

Refreshing this page.
Clearing your browser cache.

If that doesn’t help, please let us know on our Help Center!
Anyone know how to stop this? Obviously refreshed and cleared cache.

Same here… I guess something is going wrong.
Time to get a hot drink I  

Cheers for that, least it’s not on my end! Tea or coffee?

And it’s working again! Hope it does for you too

And just like that we’re back in!

Same happened to me. Although it´s back up now!!

2,Mkdir to make new directory on local computer,"Get Help,Git",basic-get,3,"
I am trying to create a directory. So first I type in - cd C:/Desktop/codecademy - the I type - mkdir excursion.
A folder name excursion should appear in codecademy folder but nothing appears.
can you tell me the process. Thanks.
The link to the project is as follows:
Excursion Project
https://www.codecademy.com/paths/learn-how-to-build-websites/tracks/finishing-touches-and-publishing-a-website/modules/git-and-publishing-to-github-pages/projects/f1-excursion
","
Is it just a case of file explorer not updating? If you right-cliked and used refresh does it pop up then?
What about just using ls immediately afterwards?
Is this windows? What shell are you using? Can you use mkdir with the verbose flag on?

I’ve got it now. I had to move down the directory one at a time.  so first I entered “pwd” > I was at “C:\Documents and Settings\user” > I moved to Desktop by entering “cd Desktop” > then I entered next directory “codecademy” > I then created a new directory inside codecademy by entering “mkdir excursion”.
So what I learnt is that you have to move up the link of directory one at a time. Thanks tgrtim.

3,Unable to link local repository to GitHub repository - fatal: pathspec 'README.txt' did not match any files,"Get Help,Git",general,10,"
Hi everyone,
I am having issues with setting up my Git repository and linking it to GItHub.  I am following the video below:
Link - Windows version
When I try to add a readme.txt file it states:
$ git add README.txt
fatal: pathspec 'README.txt' did not match any files

I believe I have successfully setup my username and email:  Here is what my repository looks like in File Explorer:
image769×261 6.44 KB
Finally Git Bash is also returning the below error when I try to push something to my github reporitory:
$ git push -u origin master
error: src refspec master does not match any
error: failed to push some refs to ‘’
I appreciate any help I can get!

$ git add README.txt
fatal: pathspec 'README.txt' did not match any files

Are you in the same directory as README.txt?

Yes I am.  Image is below:
image1192×186 11 KB

Hm, the image doesn’t show that readme.txt is in users? You would confirm with an ls command.
Even if the file hasn’t been modified, you should be able to git add the file if it’s in the directory.
@jrb0831 Try looking at these examples. I feel like one of these s going to help: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4181861/message-src-refspec-master-does-not-match-any-when-pushing-commits-in-git
As for following videos… Yea, the thing is unless you can recreate the environment of the video perfectly, you can’t always assume the same results. In a way, it’s these detours that help one understand the structure a little bit better of what goes on.

That was it.  I had mistakenly named the file README.txt.txt 
However when trying to push my repository to Git repository to GitHub I receive the below error:
image1184×131 8.27 KB
I feel like I went wrong somewhere during my configuration but have no clue where.  I’ve been following the video step-by-step.
Thank you for all your help!

I think that’s a case of updating your repo through github.com itself so that your online commit is now ahead of your local commit.
You’ll want to fetch that online commit and merge it with your own. Will add a little detail in a minute.

If you don’t have important changes in your local commit you could just do a git pull followed by git push which would fetch the newest commits from your online repo and automatically merge them with your local commit (most of the time this is fine anyway with the standard merge methods) followed by a push of the newly merged commits to your remote repo. This is probably the best choice for now unless you wanted to do some extra reading.
If you want to be extra cautious you can use git fetch to get the updated versions without an automatic merge. You’ll find them as branches prepended with the name you use for your pull remote (in this case origin) so master for example would be origin/master. You can then use them like a normal branch and check merge options in detail .e.g --dry-run to be sure your merge is safe.

Thanks for the information but I think I might be misunderstanding something.  I’ve ran git pull and followed it up with git push which seem to run without error.  I believe this is pulling everything from my existing online repository down to my local repository and then I am pushing it all back up (keeping everything in sync).  However I still cannot run:
$ git push -u origin master
error: src refspec master does not match any
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/xxx/git_practice.git'


Ooh sorry, that’s not what I thought it was. I’d have a look at this SO query to see if any of it covers your issue-

4,Git Bash Not Recognizing Changes,"Get Help,Git",,6,"
I’m learning about git commands at the moment and i understand the commands for the most part, my only question at the moment is how and where do i make the changes to a file in order for git to register the changes? I have set the repository and added the file. But do i go into the file, make a change then go back to git and add the file again? Because when i do, even if i add a line AND save, then add it, when i use “git diff” nothing pops up. it doesn’t see that i have made changes.
","
What two things did you diff? You left that to the default behaviour right? So which two things did it compare by default and did you make those two things be different?
When you’re editing a file, you are not “in the file”. Your editor is displaying some text. What’s in the file is what sits on the disk, your edits only end up in the file after you’ve told your editor to save the content.
git does not pay attention to when you write to a file or what you do in a text editor.
you can add files to git’s staging area, and from that make a commit when you’ve added all changes that you want your commit to consist of.
if you want to diff two things, then unless you want to diff the two things that git diffs by default when you don’t specify anything, then you will need to specify the two things you wish to diff.

Well in the lesson itll say to add a line to which it shows at the top something like “scene-1.txt”. so i add a line to scene-1.txt, do “git add scene-1.txt”, then i just type git diff scene-1.txt to see what changes were made. and it showed the new line that was added. i didnt have to specify anything. but also okay so if i dont edit through the text editor how would i add stuff to the text file like i am doing in the lessons. Heres The Lesson
Also as a side note, in git bash when i try to commit from my personal git bash app, i get a user name error. saying to specify my name.

No you would use a text editor to edit text files. The point is git has nothing to do with that.
You can specify a name when you make a commit or in a configuration file (https://git-scm.com/docs)
If you add your changes and then run git diff with no arguments, then you’ll get no changes showing up, because you eliminated the difference between the two things you’re comparing. If you get a difference anyway then you did something else. (if you make b the same as a and then compare a to b then you’ll have no difference)

Hi,
I am writing the following code in git bash shell: mkdir excursion. a folder by the name excursion should show up in my codecademy directory but nothing shows up. I make sure that i am in codecademy directory by typing: cd Desktop/codecademy.

Just note in the future how old a thread as this query might’ve been better as a new thread. Could you try with the verbose flag? Like so-
mkdir -v directoryname

Git message are useful to quickly to gain an overview of what changes are made, which is why commit messages should be descriptive. Especially when you work with other people at a project

So, what’s the answer to the question?  How do we resolve this - for those of us who don’t follow the code above.

The answer is literally in one of @halimhamidov his answers. the command is (as you could read in documentation):
git config --global user.email ""your@email.com""

In this exercise,we use “git checkout” for  switch to the new branch , but in backtracking lesson we use “git checkout” for restore the file in your working directory to look exactly as it did when you last made a commit.How can I distinguish these commands?

","
I’m only going through some of these myself at the minute so take this all with a pinch of salt (any advice may sit somewhere between simply inaccurate to wildly incorrect ). From what I understand checkout is used to alter the state your current working directory. This can be switching to a new branch or reverting to your last commit (also allows changes on a smaller file by file basis).
You can also view previous commits on a branch but it gets a bit more complex (detached HEAD state if you want to look into it) because you can’t just start working from this point (or at least you’d no longer be making changes to an active branch). You’d need to either shift the branch to this commit (something like git reset) or you’d want a new branch at this point to start developing on.
Basic docs are linked below but a number of online queries delve into the detached HEAD state if you wanted more guidance-
https://git-scm.com/docs/git-checkout

Hey, when I went through the git module it didn’t sink in immediately. Not too long afterwards I ran into this CS50 video from Harvard (https://youtu.be/1u2qu-EmIRc) that I thought did a really nice job at concisely explaining it (with good visuals).

why are using vi? If you find vi ( a command line text-editor), you might want tell git to use nano instead (you can google how to make nano the default editor for git)
to exit vi, first type a colon (:), then type wq (write quite) or q! (quit without saving) and press enter.

yes, i will  try out!
I type “git pull” in the command line, then I press enter and I get stucked in nano. I am not using vi, it happens by itself, something is wrong with “git pull”

like the file says, please enter a commit message to explain why this merge is necessary. Which is why you get the file.
Doesn’t like nano? Looks like vi. Nano should be easy to exit (ctrl + x if i remember correctly)
vi(m) seems to be the default:
https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/gitlab-cookbook/9781783986842/apas07.html
so I would recommend changing the default editor.

it means I type colon ( then I press q
and then I type: git commit -m “merge necessary”  enter
yes?

or you can type the reason why you merged directly in that file. But I am not going to cover vim, that is something you can find a tutorial for 
commit messages are there to remind yourself later (and others), why you made a merge. Merge necessary is not really a why.

so as I understand git pull command calls vim?!
I don’t understand how it could happen that I need something to merge? I always push from my local folder to GitHub, only one direction
and now If I want to push something the command line tells me I have to pull first, cause  I have different commits,
I am not interested in vim, thank you for your previous key-tip ( if I am stucked in vim again)




 justsql:

so as I understand git pull command calls vim?!


no, it calls whatever command line text-editor you have configured. This behavior allows you to write a message as to why you merged.



 justsql:

I don’t understand how it could happen that I need something to merge?


And you are the only one working on the project? You might be able to figure out with git log to start seeing what you needed to pull. Although your command line should tell you after you merged and exited vim.

I started on git recently as well, following the directions for the Mac since I use debian linux (raspberry pi).  I see that message open an editor, then I close it, and then see success anyway.
By the way, if you’re only using git on your system and not merging with anyone else, then just use git push when pushing updates.

Hello,
just simple git push does not work, it seems that my remote and my local repository diverge in commits, i guess.
I  tried to add my modified index.html file and I committed it and then I tried to push it and then I got the Hint: The updates were rejected because the tip of your current branch is behind its remote counterpart.

Hey harrjt,
Unfortunately git push origin master didn’t work, maybe there is another solution?


you can just run:
git pull

git says the changes can be fast forwarded.

I did and then I had to select between Recovery Delete Edit Quit: First I selected Recover then I end up being stucked, then I did it again and I selected Delete
something happened,
Then I should commit and I simply typed git commit “complete merge” and then everything worked
So far I understand what was wrong, but still I am wondering about things which are executed via command line,
Thanks for helping me!

I have no idea. If i had a problem like that, i would use google to find out what might cause it. Even as a developer, you can’t know everything (That includes me)

This says that you haven’t added any update with git add.  So your next step is to add the file you modified.

git add index.html
git commit -m “your message here”

and when your ready to push your update from the command line

git push

I think it’s saying the origin branch has 2 more commits than your local branch (meaning, there have been 2 extra commits since your last local commit).
What happens when you try to  git pull? If (and that’s really if) you wanted to update your local branch that would be the thing to do.

presumably origin already exists due to you having previously added it sometime before the commands you’re showing

I am in the basic git workflow part of my computer science path, everything is going fine, actually more than fine. I got so much in love with git i downloaded the desktop version of github on my desktop and uploaded projects im working on from other cs courses. I just want to know what the lines printed actually mean. In particular the lines after git commit:


“create mode 100644”
“70 insertions(+)”

Thank you in advance for answering.
","
I’ll keep it short rather than going into much details 

Create Mode: - Tells about permissions given to that file, i.e., File permissions. Here, 100644 means the file is a normal file.
Insertions:- It means the number of files added in that particular commit.

To learn more about it, you can also refer to git documentation here.

Thanks a million! why are the permissions gives such codes tho?

Assume we have a file which is having these permissions

In CLI if we would see these kinds of permissions listed, it would be a lot of clutter. It’s natural we would like to find some shorthand notation for it. Just like abbreviations are there to reference something. We would like to keep it simple so that we can know as much about a file in a crux and fast way without going over more detailed information.
If you wanna know more about file permissions and their role check here
Conclusion: It’s just a shorthand notation for files.
P.S. I answered what I thought was best to my knowledge.However, I do recommend you to learn more about it from other internet resources. Don’t dive too much deep otherwise you’ll  be overwhelmed with so much information.

Hi @jasonstuardoruizmart
That error code (fatal: remote origin already exists) is telling you the issue, you have already have a remote saved with that name. If you remove it, git remote rm origin and then add a new one with the correct repo link (with the correct username etc.)- git remote add origin https://github.com/--usernamegoeshere--/git_practice.git you could continue with that lesson.

git remote rm origin

Hey,
You are linking to a file on your own computer, a direct path rather than a relative path.
<link href=""C:\Users\Verno\Documents\Websites\excursion\excursiongithub.io\resources\css\style.css"" type=""text/css"" rel=""stylesheet"">

And you should be good to go 

That seemed to work. in the code that you provided is the “resources\css\style.css” the pathway from github?

No, it is the pathway of the directory your CSS is in relative to the HTML file. Just like the folder on your computer. By linking relative to the HTML file you the HTML knows where to pick up the files.
You may want to look into your href of your images aswell.

I did exactly that and everything came up working properly.  Thank you

Yes.  I understand what went wrong but i’m not certain how to explain it in words.  here goes my attempt at explaining it in words.

I then initialized that into a Github repository.
once in there, the pathways to my style sheet, images, and videos were all in the resources folder that is located in the Github respitory.
Please correct and verbage I used incorrectly.

In your HTML you linked to local files using an absolute path rather than a relative path.
An absolute path is a path that describes the location of a file or folder regardless of the current working directory; in fact, it is relative to the root directory. It contains the complete location of a file or directory, hence the name.
whilst
A relative path is a path that describes the location of a file or folder in relative to the current working directory.
The moment you created the GitHub repository and pushed your files, the HTML still had its absolute path, but inside a location (git repository) where this link is not existing.
I suggest making it a habit of always using a relative path link so that no matter where you place the whole website folder your HTML can find the files required.

Thank you.  This was very very helpful.

Most likely there are no commits. You could check whether there are.
For anyone to actually tell you anything about YOUR situation, you would need to provide a way to reproduce it. Either through some exact series of steps (which you’re likely to get wrong let’s be honest) or through an archive of your directory (zip file)

Hi there.
Possibly a silly question, but you do have a file in that location called README.txt, right? 

thanks for your response. yeah sure, i found the solution so far, i went to view at the heading bar, and put a check mark in the hidden items box. but now i want to add the README.txt to git , but the server tell me that it “did not match any files”

Yes, that error suggests that git can’t find the file you’re trying to add.
It’s not something daft like the filename actually being README.txt.txt or something is it?

yeah i type ls , the output is README.txt.txt, it means that the file is saved on this name, but why ? since i typed README.txt and that is what appear in my repository.

Hello,
Just wondering about the options going forward and what system I need to use for showcasing my learning to employers and putting solutions on to here/anywhere.
It’s been suggested by Codecademy that GitHub should be used.
So, I’m wondering if this is the case if using the DB Browser as well? Does it not have the same functionality?
Github is probably just the more prefered platform?
Any advice on using Github over DB Browser would be great, as I find DB Browser very easy to use and would be personally prefered.

So, I’m wondering if this is the case if using the DB Browser as well? Does it not have the same functionality?


Googling db browser gives me this:
https://sqlitebrowser.org/
is that what you mean?
In that case, use both. They serve different purposes, git is version control while DB browser is used to manage your database
in an application, database is just one of multiple layers

Thanks for clearing that up for me.
Just trying to get my head around all the new portals, licenses, software etc.
So I now face the choice or learning it all the hard way, command style, or going the easy way, DB Browser.
Surely I should learn it the proper way first, then go DB later as employers might need me to write commands without DB being an option?

I haven’t use SQLite much, mostly mySQL. For which i used mysql workbench. Which is totally fine to get started with, makes it a lot easier to run multiple queries, put your query on multiple lines for readability.



 beta3952103217:

With databases, you just need to get started. Writing your own database system from scratch would take years, and by the time you are done, your code is outdated.

So I understand from what you’re saying, as long as I keep up to date with relevant software packages(DB Browser/MySQL Workbench etc), I should be fine to navigate/find what I want, from where I want and employers won’t be testing me on my ability to code perfect without them from the get go.
I had imagined I would be creating a database to begin with, but interesting concept!
I’m trying the data science route, mainly trying to get into data analytics as I’ve really enjoyed working with Excel and designing semi automated spreadsheets, also most realistic for me where my career si to side step into that industry.

No, the DB browser and mySQL are just GUI programs to manage your databases
the tricky bit is actually knowing SQL (structured query language), which you use create tables, read information and much more). You need to understand joins, aggregates and more.

I know about aggregates and basics, as I’ve just completed both, now on to multiple tables.
I’ll stick to learning from  Codecademy browser for now.

25,Getting Started with Git and Github Mac,"Get Help,Git",general,15,"
Hi everyone,
I was in the process of setting up Git and GitHub to link them to a CodeAcademy Project for the first time using this video for Mac: https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=905&v=tMDbJ0DDuug&feature=emb_logo
Everything was working fine, but when I got to one of the last steps:
…or push an existing repository from the command line
git remote add origin https://github.com/jeaninewilson2020/git_practice.git git push -u origin master

and copied and pasted the code into Terminal, I received this error message:
fatal: not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git
I tried closing and opening Terminal but still receive the same error message.
","
setting up the remote and pushing in one go? Seems ambitious.
Anyway, did you create a repository in your project as well? You need to create a repository before you can add a remote source.

I have set up the repository. How do I add in the HTML and CSS code from my project onto the repository?




 ruby9951660504:

I have set up the repository.


where? On github or on your local machine? You should do both, and then set the github repository as remote in your local git repo.

I’ve done both, I’ve entered this code in Terminal:
Jeanines-MBP:my-project jeaninewilson$ git remote add origin https://github.com/jeaninewilson2020/myproject.git
Jeanines-MBP:my-project jeaninewilson$ git remote -v
origin https://github.com/jeaninewilson2020/myproject.git (fetch)
origin (link hidden) (push)
Jeanines-MBP:my-project jeaninewilson$
How do I now link my work so that it shows up in GitHub?

so the link is established? Then you can do a commit and a push

I think so; I can see the “Readme.txt” on Github. Do I need to save the project onto my machine first (and if so in what format) to do a commit and push? I take it I can’t copy the HTML code into Terminal.
Sorry for all the questions, I’m totally new to this!




 ruby9951660504:

I can see the “Readme.txt” on Github.


then you might need to do pull first. Given github won’t allow you to do a push if there a files on github which aren’t merged with your local version of the project
What do you mean format? What do you think git is and does? I am trying to see where you are struggling.

I see; how do I do a pull?
I mean do I need to save my work as a .html file on my machine. My understanding (from the video I originally linked to) is that I should be able to have my work linked on GitHub and I can then share that link to get feedback on my projects




 ruby9951660504:

I see; how do I do a pull?


have you consult the documentation? A google search like: git pull, should help you massively.



 ruby9951660504:

I mean do I need to save my work as a .html file on my machine.


Good question. I know the answer, but what do you think? 
here is the answer, but take some time to think about the question before viewing this:  the answer is: yes



 ruby9951660504:

is that I should be able to have my work linked on GitHub and I can then share that link to get feedback on my projects


But if that is what you are after, why not use dropbox? Or google drive? Or one of the other million file sharing services. What is different about git and github? (git and github are not the same thing)
Understanding the tools you are working with is very important. Of course i could spoon feed you all the answers, but i am not going to. Because i want you to ask the right questions. And act upon these questions. Search the internet

Maybe you should search for a tutorial then? There are plenty

Which question? About git and github being different?
It’s different because it allows collaboration on code, without the danger of overwriting someone else’s work…

git is version control, you can overwrite someones code, but you can also revert it
github is just the central hub of the version control system.

You’d need to commit AFTER setting your name and email. Not BEFORE because at that point you’ve still not addressed the problem.
…since you’ve now set those things, commit

If you’re denied permission to create a directory then you might want to check where you’re trying to create it
(well, actually, you should know where you are trying to create it before you do, obviously)
And whether you have permissions to write to that location
For example, if you’re trying to create a directory in C:\Windows\System32\ then, yeah, that’s going to get denied.
Or maybe you’re in a completely reasonable location but have tinkered with the permissions there and would need to undo it.
Reasonable location typically means somewhere under your home directory.
Or maybe the command you used just don’t make much sense, and then you’d need to reconsider how the program you’re using to create a directory is at all used.

Hey @maureen_to!
You should create a new branch when you are making major changes to your project or just creating a new feature that might break something. So, for example, if I’m refactoring all my code, deleting large chunks and replacing it with smaller, better code, then I would want to do that on an alternative branch so I can make the changes without worrying about breaking something by accident.
I’m exactly sure what you’re asking in your second question… the best way to go about what?

That makes sense! Thank you - your answer answered my second question.

For test purposes, I cloned a repo and didn’t create a new branch. Made changes to master branch (local repo) and now I wished to push it. The command “git push origin master” fatal errors. Does this mean, a new branch has to be created in your local clone ?

You’d remake the commit from the previous one, discarding the “mistake” commit. ie. you would reset to a previous commit without changing your local files, then commit again.
You can do it with git commit --amend, or you can just go ahead and keep committing and squash it down into a single or a few commits later.

seems to suggest you can use Advanced Packaging Tool (APT), which is standard for linux. This certainly includes git.
chromebooks are really focused on cloud, not much running programs locally. Have you considered a normal laptop and installing linux on it?




 stetim94:

Have you considered a normal laptop and installing linux on it?


A lot of people are getting chromebooks nowadays. That is what I’m on some of the time. Most because it has fast loading with built-in virus protection so I don’t have to wait on downloads.

I did install linux on my old laptop but it got rid of my wi-fi capability (and I can’t figure out how to fix it cuz all the fixes on the forums for my old one didn’t work) and It was still running REALLY slow, hence the new computer. I haven’t used linux since the early 90’s so I’m basically starting all over no matter what I do ):

But how powerful are the chromebooks? Given its nice to have a local development environment. I like jetbrains IDE (like phpstorm and pycharm), but those are very heavy.
@willowdb, so for i researched it, chromebooks are  linux based. Linux has come a long way since the early 90’s.

The chromebooks are light. And also for a college student with tight money, it works great.

Another thing I like about it. (this is not an ad)
EDIT: Is it the most practical for coding? Porbably not. But its still good, and has its own benefits.

When I push my file into GitHub.

 ngvunhathao:

After than, Can I delete all file on my computer ???


why would you do that? That means you have to pull the files/clone the repository again before you can start working again.

because My laptop so weak, so I want to delete after I push on GitHub
. Can I do that?
I think the way clone/ pull , it’s not take a lot of my time




 ngvunhathao:

o I want to delete after I push on GitHub
. Can I do that?


can you? Yes. Should you? No. git has always been intended to have one central repository (github) and every developer working on the project have a local copy of this repository.
besides, files on your computer (while  not using them) only take up storage. So you have a storage problem?




 stetim94:

git has always been intended to have one central repository


meh? no. it is distributed. there isn’t a central repository. no action requires a central server. you can use it with multiple users without a central repository. but having an always-online central node is handy.



 ngvunhathao:

Can I delete all file on my computer


That’s not related to uploading files. You can delete them either way. Maybe you mean to ask whether copying your data… copies it. It does. Is there data that you would want to keep in your repository… That depends, what do you want to keep? If you don’t want to keep anything other than what’s now also in the other repository then no there’s nothing you’d want to keep. That could be branches that you didn’t push to the other repository, or untracked files, or metadata like where the other repository exists. I’m sure you’ve noticed these are all circular arguments, that’s because nobody can tell you whether you want to delete something. Commit what you want to keep, push the changes to a remote repository, and then sure, since you committed everything you care about, delete your copy. Git repositories are pretty compact though (so long as you’re only keeping text in it) so perhaps it makes more sense to remove everything except the repository (git clean).

39,Git Bash For windows,"Get Help,Git",,7,"
I’m trying to do the exercises with Git fo windows that code academy gives me but I cant. When I try to mkdir in the git bash it says ""cannot create directory ‘bum’: Permission denied
"" how can I get permission for that so I can continue my courses.
","
being denied permission doesn’t necessarily mean the best way forward is to get permission, there’s also the option of reconsidering what you meant to do.
For example, if you’re trying to create your directory in C:/Program Files then rather than forcing it with admin you might want to create it somewhere under your user directory, like C:/Users/Jimmy/workspace

thanks. But I don’t know how to get there. when I run the comman pwd this is what it shows me ""damib@LAPTOP-O03VI3MP MINGW64 /
"" I don’t even know whats that. why it doesn’t say windows C: or something? besides, im worried that using git on my own pc could damage something if I mess up

A lot of unix tools assume the file system starts at /, not at some drive letter, and definitely not at some un-addressable thing where the drive letters exist.
I think mingw might place your C drive at /c, so you’d navigate to…
$ cd /c/Users/Jimmy
$ mkdir workspace

There might also be  a home directory somewhere under mingw:
$ cd ~   # bash replaces ~ with the location of your home directory
$ mkdir workspace

Your result of pwd, damib@LAPTOP-O03VI3MP MINGW64 /
Suggests that you’re at the very top of the file system (/), normally you’d do things from /home/Jimmy, assuming that a directory exists for your user, that’s where you’d have write permission (as opposed to in locations owned by the os, which might not even have a physical location in your hard drive)

Hello, I had the same problem.
I can go to cd ~ folder, and create a directory there. But i can’t create a directory in “C:\Program Files\Git”.  When I analyze this folder, I see that it is read only for admin and users by default. (i don’t know why is this so?)
I changed the permissions to full authority for the admin and users. Therefore I can create directory right now. I hope my solution doesn’t damage any other thing:sweat_smile:

Imagine driving on a road.
The road is blocked.
You decide that this means you need to unblock it.
You continue to drive.
You fall off a cliff.
Guess why it was blocked.
The road block wasn’t telling you that you need to remove it, but that you probably meant to go somewhere else.

I get the feeling that the only reason you think you need to change anything about C:\Program Files is that you were denied permission to do so. There are plenty of directories where you already have write access, is there anything wrong with those? Is your solution solving a problem?

Yes it solved the problem, but I get your point.
I will try another approach.
Thanks a lot!

git status shows un-comitted  files.
use git log to see your commits

Yes, I can see my initial commit when I use git log, but when I try and git add the script.py file again (after populating and saving it), it won’t let me git commit that file to the repository.

and there is no second commit in the log? Do you get an error when attempting the second commit?
Did you press the save button to save the file? Its the only way i can replicate your issue

nope, no second commit. even after pressing save. the message I get when attempting the second commit is:
On branch master
nothing to commit, working tree clean
This happens every single time, even if I try resetting the project and initializing another git repository

can’t replicate issue:

but then i press the save button, and everything works.
you could try to edit the file in the command line using nano? type: nano script.py in the command line.

Huh, it looks like it works now! Maybe I was clicking save at the wrong time? Regardless, thank you so much for the help!!

you need to press save after making the changes to file 
if save button ever bugs out, you can always use nano (a command line text-editor) to work around the problem (hopefully)

Thank you very much for your help. I really appreciate it 
Okay great I am getting closer but I was getting this error message:

error: failed to push some refs to ‘https://github.com/username/repository-name.git’
hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do
hint: not have locally. This is usually caused by another repository pushing
hint: to the same ref. You may want to first integrate the remote changes
hint: (e.g., ‘git pull …’) before pushing again.
hint: See the ‘Note about fast-forwards’ in ‘git push --help’ for details.

I was able to resolve by doing git pull due to the master being four edits ahead of origin. Then git push then I ran the command again git push origin master and lo & behold all my commits synced to my GitHub’s repository.
I do still have one question though. I was not prompted for username and password for the git push origin master. I thought I needed to enter this every time I pushed to the GitHub repository since I am not using SSH. How often will I be required to enter my GitHub username/password to push commits to GitHub?
Thank you again

https://www.codecademy.com/paths/computer-science/tracks/cspath-development-skills/modules/learn-git-git-workflow-u/articles/f1-u3-git-setup
I’m having trouble storing my GitHub credentials in Git and therefore can’t commit anything.
I’ve tried running:
$ git config --global credential.helper wincred
in Gitbash but to no avail. I’m pretty new at this, but I would have thought that I need to spell out my username and password and run this in GitBash at some point so that my specific credentials can be stored.
Can someone help out a total noob?
","
credential.helper are placeholders for the credentials (user in your case), and the helper to specify which property of user), you want to set, for example:
git config --global user.name ""Mona Lisa""
git config --global user.email ""email@example.com""

the tutorial you provided also links to the documentation where you can find this:

image.png755×77 6.81 KB


Whatever you got that command from probably also explained that it is for telling git how to remember your credentials. I’d find it very surprising if this caused a a password promt, since you didn’t do anything requiring a password.
Also, why would this prevent you from committing anything? If git doesn’t already store your credentials, it asks, doesn’t it? Maybe the problem is really with what you’re doing to commit. If you’re getting any kind of error message during that then that probably contains the information you need to fix it.

I had the same problem. The article you are referencing is “Getting Started with Git and GitHub.”
For Windows users, this is very confusing:
“This portion of the guide assumes you have already installed a program called Git Bash which allows us access to Git on Windows. If you have not installed Git Bash, please refer to the previous tutorial on Command Line Interface (CLI) Setup and follow the instructions for installing Git Bash on Windows. Once you complete that you can continue with this guide.”
Not sure why they would assume we’ve installed GitBash since we were never asked or instructed in previous tutorials.  But thankfully the solution is easy. Just go to:  https://git-scm.com/download/win
This will download and install everything  you need, including GitBash.
When installation is complete just scroll down to “Try it Out” and everything from there is pretty self-explanatory. I had no problems after.

For a lot of questions the first place to check is google

the problem isn’t that the README.txt doesn’t exist, the problem is that commands (git add) can only be done if a git repository is initialized, which judging by the error isn’t the case
initializing a git repository (git init) creates a .git directory, could be a glitch in the lesson? You could initialize the repository again?

Because you might not want to commit all your files, or you want to split all the files you worked on over 3 separate commits (if you worked on many separate components within the application).
learning programming consist of two steps, learning a concept like staging area (step 1) and applying the staging area in a project (step 2) to see its value. This is not specific for staging area, but for many programming concepts
that is why these questions are so difficult to answer, because you are step 1, step 2 would be working in a group to build an application, to see the power of git. Then you can experience that staging can be very useful.

Exercise 8/10
""Delete the content of the line as it appears in the master branch
Delete all of Git’s special markings including the words HEAD and fencing. If any of Git’s markings remain, for example, >>>>>>> and =======, the conflict remains.""
I’m not exactly sure what the instructions want me to delete. Also, I’m not sure what they mean by special characters? I typed “git diff” and I notice the difference between the master branch’s resume.txt and the fencing’s resume.txt. I’m just not sure what to delete? And we’re talking about the text editor or are we talking about deleting stuff in the terminal?

If you do not supply a commit message when commiting, git opens your text editor (nano) so that you can write a commit message, save, and exit the text editor, and then git reads that file to obtain the commit message.
You still have that text editor running in your right panel, note the banner in the top stating that it’s GNU nano, and the shortcuts listed at the bottom. That isn’t bash.
So what you would do from where you are in your screenshot, is remove those 8-10 lines you wrote because those don’t belong in a commit message, and write a commit message and save and exit. Or, exit without saving and supply a commit message as an argument instead.

Hi,
Thank you for your reply. I have tried the same commands in bash but it still does not appear to work

That doesn’t tell me anything. I suggest reading any error messages git is responding with and comparing to what you want to do and from there decide what needs to be different.

type git commit -m "" change larry to laertes""
which is exactly what you did

Hello 
May I ask you to post here content of scene-3.txt file?

sure…
Hamlet: Act 1, Scene 3
A room in Polonius’ house.
Enter LARRY and OPHELIA
LARRY
My necessaries are embark’d: farewell:
And, sister, as the winds give benefit
And convoy is assistant, do not sleep,
But let me hear from you.
OPHELIA
Do you doubt that?
LARRY
For Hamlet and the trifling of his favour,
Hold it a fashion and a toy in blood,
A violet in the youth of primy nature,
Forward, not permanent, sweet, not lasting,
The perfume and suppliance of a minute; No more.
OPHELIA
No more but so?

Hm, I thought that it might be a problem with tests, I have misunderstood the question, sorry.
According to the instructions you don’t really have to use sed command, you can simply change all occurrences of LARRY to LAERTES by hand.
But if you want to, here is how to do this using sed:
Make sure that you are in the right directory
$ pwd
/home/ccuser/workspace/hamlet-prince-of-denmark

Use sed to find and replace
$ sed -i -e 's/LARRY/LAERTES/g' scene-3.txt 

-i - make changes in place
-e - we are going to define expression
's/LARRY/LAERTES/g - substitue (s) all (g) occurrences of LARRY with LAERTES
Please note that you have to close the file and open it again to see the changes. Or you can use cat command

You need to type git diff to get the difference in the files (that is not explained in the lesson).
In order to actually change the files, type “nano resume.txt” in order to open the file with the nano code editor, from where you can delete the lines as shown in the exercise. Using Ctrl + O you can then save the file, and Ctrl + X, exit the nano editor. The exercise will be successfully completed.

For anyone else having this problem all you need to do is close the file in file editor and re-open it (after you use the git checkout command, do not run, as git will see this as a new modification)

Your output in the commandline suggests that those two directories are separate repositories, which one was supposed to be edited?

Hi Ionatan ,
the one supposed to be edited is in the my-quizzes file . But it doesn’ appear as you can see . And the terminal tells me that the branch bio-questions , the bio-questions already exists ??? I don’t understand . In previous questions post  , I saw that there were two biology.txt file : one in my-quizzes and one in science-quizzes (that’s why there were mistakes)  . Here we see just one in science-quizzes and this is not the one I have to put the questions in .
So how to proceed ?

While you could fix the state of your repository, that involves knowing what it should be like (git doesn’t tell you what to do)
So you’re probably best off resetting from the first exercise of that workspace (5-6 exercises back judging by your screenshot), and follow along closely both in what commands to carry out and in what’s supposed to happen

ok I m going to try to do this yes . Thanks Ionatan !

Like, we could go about repairing it right. But I’m not sure what the point is.
It’s just a few exercises, repeating them should take a few minutes right. If you get the same thing again…
I’ll just ask you to upload it and I’ll look at it >.<

Yes it works ! The second file biology.txt appears in my-quizzes !
I had to reset . Thanks Ionatan

Yeah okay. I was just figuring out the commands for creating an archive and uploading it. I suppose I’ll abort that then… was near done tho D:
cd ~
tar -czf w.tgz ~/workspace
curl --upload-file ./w.tgz https://transfer.sh/workspace.tgz
rm w.tgz

what is it for exactly ? cd… tgz …?

tgz is short for tar and gzip, tar is short for TapeARchive (yes, it’s an old program)
tar bundles files together into a single file, gzip compresses it. cd you should know. curl does a bunch of network stuff, like fetching websites/files or in this case, uploading

What network are you using? the port might be blocked

I assume you can access github in your browser with https?
Does your browser go through a proxy?
Are you able to connect to https://github.com with curl? ie. curl https://github.com - it should output a bunch of html if successful (…assuming you have curl installed, you can try wget as well, or pretty much any tool able to connect using a specific port)

We need HTML to create the links, since JS does not have anchor or link elements (<a href></a>, <link href>). JS is only the behaviors API and does not have a principal role in creating the DOM. That comes from the Document, which is HTML.

You’d simply push to an empty repository. Yours isn’t empty though, it has a commit in it. You’ll have to decide what you want to do with that existing commit, perhaps it should be discarded (delete the repository and create it again, leaving you with an empty repository)

Your commit looks a lot like it was made by github - you probably didn’t create an empty repository, you probably checked some box asking github to add a readme

Hi ioatan - Yes, I did add a readme. I will start again tomorrow and recreate it without the empty and hopefully I’ll then be able to move on. Thank you for your help!

no, it can happen that if you type git diff (to get the difference), that you get:

You already have the target object in h3. No need to query it again.
h3.appendChild...




 yjean101:

element.appendChild(relationToHTML);


Where is element defined?



 yjean101:

Let knowledgelist = document. getElementById (‘knowledge-list’);


As before, this element is already defined and does not need to be queried again. Not to mention there is a syntax error in that line.
Above are only signposts. See where that takes you.



 yjean101:

let planetImage = document.getElementsByTagName(‘img’)[0];


If there are no images, there will be an empty collection which will likely raise an exception. The purpose here is to insert an image. That means creating an img element and populating the src attribute, et al.

We have had for a long time now document.querySelector and document.querySelectorAll. Suggest start using them and ease your burden long term.
let parent_container = document.querySelector('#knowledge-list');
let images_collection = document.querySelectorAll('img');

The hidden beauty in all this is that we can capture the first image in the collection by using the first line, above, with an img type selector.
let planetImage = document.querySelector('img');


Is there a simpler way for me to add a textNode to a order list ? or should i just leave it like this and i’m having trouble with remove and element a list
//  knowledge-list order list
function myFunction() {
let node = document.createElement(“li”);
let textnode = document.createTextNode(“Relation to HTML”);
node.appendChild(textnode);
document.getElementById(“knowledge-list”).appendChild(node);
}
myFunction();
function myFunc() {
let node = document.createElement(“li”);
let textnode = document.createTextNode(“Using the DOM”);
node.appendChild(textnode);
document.getElementById(“knowledge-list”).appendChild(node);
}
myFunc();
function myList() {
let node = document.createElement(“li”);
let textnode = document.createTextNode(“Syntax”);
node.appendChild(textnode);
document.getElementById(“knowledge-list”).appendChild(node);
}
myList();

There is not much you need to do to improve upon your code. It looks like it should function correctly. As for removing an element,

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ChildNode/remove


https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/removeChild

Study up those two methods and get familiar with their differences.
The key will be selecting the element to remove.

Okay, I remove the element from a list with this code:
I want to know is there a way to sort an order list in the Dom ?
let knowledgelist = document.getElementById(“knowledge-list”);
let threeElement = knowledgelist.children[2];
knowledgelist.removeChild(threeElement);

I want to create a aside tag in the Dom but i’m not sure if this is okay :
let asi = document.createElement(“aside”);
let asinode = document.createTextNode(“JavaScript is only fun when we can use it to manipulate HTML!”);
asi.appendChild(asinode);




 yjean101:

is there a way to sort an order list in the Dom ?


We would need to make a copy of the list text nodes and then sort it, then recompose and reinsert it.
This is the sort function for ascending order…
list.sort(function (a, b) { return a > b; });




 yjean101:

asi.appendChild(asinode);


This is still not inserted into the DOM. The ASIDE node needs to be appended to a parent (or to the BODY).

For the sorting, the order list can I use the insertBefore() Method

can I use the insertBefore() Method


In a nightmarish scenario you could, but that would be manual sorting which can get pretty messy. Remember, it is the text nodes that are being sorted. Being as all the child elements of the list are LI, that should not interfere with the sort so the text shouldn’t need to be extracted. Consider…
list = [`<li>z</li>`, `<li>w</li>`, `<li>n</li>`, `<li>p</li>`, `<li>d</li>`, `<li>f</li>`];

list.sort((a,b) => a > b);

console.log(list);

[ '<li>d</li>',
  '<li>f</li>',
  '<li>n</li>',
  '<li>p</li>',
  '<li>w</li>',
  '<li>z</li>' ]

A node list is not an array, but a collection. I’ve never tried sorting nodes before so we are both going to have to learn how to do that. Be sure you share your findings so I’m not stumbling around in the dark.

Note there is a more common approach to the sort…
let list = [94,28,17,30,79,85,16,73];

list.sort((a,b) => a - b);

console.log(list);

[ 16, 17, 28, 30, 73, 79, 85, 94 ]

In reverse,
list.sort((a,b) => b - a);

console.log(list);

[ 94, 85, 79, 73, 30, 28, 17, 16 ]

For text, though, it seems we need to use >.
list = [`<li>z</li>`, `<li>w</li>`, `<li>n</li>`, `<li>p</li>`, `<li>d</li>`, `<li>f</li>`];

list.sort((a,b) => b > a);

console.log(list);

[ '<li>z</li>',
  '<li>w</li>',
  '<li>p</li>',
  '<li>n</li>',
  '<li>f</li>',
  '<li>d</li>' ]

Here is SO post about sorting a node list…

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29734337/javascript-obtain-nodelist-convert-nodelist-to-an-array-sort-the-array-and

Be sure to look at the FIDDLE in the first reply.
Just ran a test and the text nodes do need to be compared separate of the element container.
bugArray.sort(function(a, b) {
    return a.innerHTML.localeCompare(b.innerHTML);
}).forEach(function(bug) {
    ul.appendChild(bug);
});

I see that the run and reset buttons are inactive, have you tried clearing your browser history or trying a different browser?

Hi! It also happened to me, try making this:
If your cursor gets stuck in “git log” mode in the terminal, press “q” on your keyboard to escape.
I hope that helps 

I’m struggling with the same issue. I have tried both recommended troubleshoots, but I’m still struggling. PLEASE HELP! 

Same problem here, and it says “lost connection to Codecademy” in the upper right corner, despite my being able to navigate the site otherwise. Switching browsers didn’t help, and pressing ‘q’ didn’t help. I’m not going to delete my browser history, and I doubt it would matter, because there is no Codecademy history in my other browser.

Hi dear friend, the ONLY think i can answer is the topic 2 about Ctrl-V. Remember you’re in a bash environment (shell command), here it’s not allowed to copy and paste as usually you do in windows. You need to type all commands. Other way to recover your past entered commands is using your cursor and the re-edit your past commands.

The instructions are quite clear and easy at the beginning but can become challenging as you move on, and this is VERY positive as you will have to learn how to solve problems and keep a constant and defined coding path.

What do you mean? Can i see a print screen? Maybe refresh the page

I’m stuck on this step
3.We must fix the merge conflict.
In the code editor, look at resume.txt. Git uses markings to indicate the HEAD (master) version of the file and the fencing version of the file, like this:
<<<<<<< HEAD
master version of line
fencing version of line







fencing







Git asks us which version of the file to keep: the version on master or the version on fencing. You decide you want the fencing version.
From the code editor:
Delete the content of the line as it appears in the master branch
Delete all of Git’s special markings including the words HEAD and fencing. If any of Git’s markings remain, for example, >>>>>>> and =======, the conflict remains.
Try reloading the page if Git’s markings don’t show up.

you can just open the file from the central window (open file button)? And then the delete the required lines, or if you feel more comfortable with command line editors you can do: nano <filename>

Thank you. It worked with nano!

97,Replacing arrays within arrays? Help!,"Get Help,Git",,3,"
Hello. I’ve created an interesting sort of array. I suppose it’s a bunch of arrays within an array.
It looks like this:
        var wallLocations = [[0, 0, 48, 600],
                             [0, 528, 3186, 72],
                             [3144, -100, 42, 700],
                             [93, 384, 225, 30],
                             [891, 159, 342, 69],
                             [1215, 375, 342, 69],
                             [1470, 66, 342, 69],
                             [1800, 342, 342, 69],
                             [2106, 69, 342, 69],
                             [1215, 375, 342, 69],
                             [2301, 465, 63, 63],
                             [2736, 465, 63, 63]];

Now whenever I go to most sites they say to splice the array. But I really don’t understand how I would do that.
My goal is to replace  [93, 384, 225, 30] with [0, 525, 372, 72], but I don’t quite understand how that works. If someone could explain that to me, it’d be much appreciated.
","
One useful tool  is Array.prototype.indexOf.
var found = wallLocations.indexOf([93, 384, 225, 30]);
if (found !== -1) {
    wallLocations[found] =  [0, 525, 372, 72];
}


found
-1
wallLocations[3]
Array [ 93, 384, 225, 30 ]
wallLocations[3].indexOf(93)
0

Looks like indexOf cannot find an array. Back to the drawing board.

Another fail…
function listReplace(parent, target, replacement) { 
var truth = false; 
for (var row = 0; row < parent.length; row++) {
for (var col = 0; col < row.length; col++) {
truth = parent[row][col] == target[col];
}
if (! truth) continue;
for (col = 0; col < row.length; col++) {
parent[row][col] = replacement[col];
return true;
}
}
return false;
}


undefined
listReplace(wallLocations, [93, 384, 225, 30], [0, 525, 372, 72])
false

Of course this is seat of the pants. command line code. Need to open a sandbox…

Success…

Notice that the inner loop short-circuits on false and the outer loop short circuits on true? The inner is akin to AND logic, and the outer is akin to OR logic. I say ‘akin’ because it is observalbe here merely by coincidence. They bear a similarity, is all.

106,Understanding branches and directories,"Get Help,Git",,2,"
EDIT: ignore this, I just realised that my local copy won’t change until I GIT ADD and GIT COMMIT!
Further to my last message, in “6. Git workflow”, I’m again confused.
In the shell, there is a “science-quizzes” (Sally’s copies of the files) directory and a “my-quizzes” directory (my own copy of her files).
I also now have a MASTER branch and a BIO-QUESTIONS branch in “my-quizzes”.
Is it correct to say that there are now essentially 3 copies of Sally’s files?  One in her master branch, one in my master branch and one in my bio-questions branch?
And if I then edit and save the biology.txt file while on the bio-questions branch, if I GIT CHECKOUT MASTER to change back to my master branch I should see an un-edited version of the biology.txt file?
This doesn’t seem to be happening.  If I look on the file browser, or use VI-editor, no matter which branch I change to in “my-quizzes” I see the same, edited, biology.txt file.
I am obviously misunderstanding the branching process in relation to local files/directories.  Can anyone explain better?
Thanks,
Dave

107,Difference between FETCH and MERGE,"Get Help,Git",,2,"
Hi,
I’m confused by what is happening with FETCH and MERGE in these exercises.
GIT FETCH apparently compares Sally’s files with my own.  Then, quote,
""brings those changes onto what’s called a remote branch ""
What is meant by “remote branch”?  Is there actually a branch called “remote”?  Where is this?  Or is it that Sally’s directory (“science-quizzes”) is a local branch just like my directory (“my-quizzes”) and all FETCH has done is drag her files to central repo (?) or branch?
I feel like I’m mixing up terminology here, confusing branches, repos, cloned copies and directories.
In exercise 5/8 it then goes on to say:
“Even though Sally’s new commits have been fetched to your local copy of the Git project, those commits are on the origin/master branch. Your local master branch has not been updated yet, so you can’t view or make changes to any of the work she has added.”
Can anyone explain this a little better?  I am getting confused between the directories we created (“science-quizzes” and “my-quizzes”) the repos (“origin”, “remote” and “local”) and my branches (“master”, “remote”)
What exactly did the FETCH command do which wasn’t done by the MERGE command, and vice versa?
Thanks,
Dave

Did you mean this?

fatal: Not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git
","
Hey Landen. It sounds like you may have corrupted the directories/branches while you were trying to figure it out. I was struggling with this one too, but I solved it. Here are my steps:
Reset the console & directories:

Click on the “Get Help” button in the bottom right hand corner.
Click on the “I want to restart this exercise” in the drop-up menu.

Enter the following commands to the terminal:

$ cd my-quizzes
$ git fetch origin
$ git merge origin/master
$ git log

Why this works:
"" git fetch"" - Downloads object(s) and ref(s) from another repository. Apparently the origin/master is not part of your local copy, so you have to download it with "" git fetch"" before you can merge.

um do $cd my-quizzes
no $git

It works perfectly… Thank you…

When i enter git fetch orgin, it says
fatal: ‘orgin’ does not appear to be a git repository
fatal: Could not read from remote repository.
Please make sure you have the correct access rights
and the repository exists.

Mr. Winkler,
This worked perfectly–how did you know to do that?

facts are that you did not switch directories since
$ git cd 


will not do anything because it is not a git command.
use the regular command which is just
$ cd my-quizzes


this is by the way clearly indicated by the error message, that is telling you, that the directory you’re in is not a git repo

do
$ pwd


and check if you’re really in the directory that you want to be in.
The error message that you get, is indicating that you’re not in a directory that is a git repo

haye guys this is not working for me

thank you , nice 

my problem is step 3

Perfecto! thank you very much!

you are my savior! i love you #20charikturs

bash: cd: my-quizzes: No such file or directory

enter cd in stead of the “ls”

Hi
I believe it is:
git fetch origin,
followed by git merge master/origin
hope this helps
(originally answer posted by danishnanozero in another thread)

correct answer is:
step 1:
cd my-quizzes
step 2:
git fetch origin
git merge origin/master
step 3:
git log

Thanks it`s really work!

hey guys ,that is a good solution.
If it does not work at the beginning,
clear the terminal (git init )and try again.

Refreshing the browser and doing the git fetch and git merge origin/master over again is what did the trick for me.

Here too. I totally missed using fetch first.
But does your output look the same? I don’t see any deletions on mine.
My light went green so I can move on, so I assume things change from time to time in the repo as they update &/or reset it.

Hello there, I got the answer right, but why would git fetch origin
git merge origin/master works? could someone explain if possible?

How would you describe this big problem?
Helping is really hard when one doesn’t know what the matter is.

git clone remote_location clone_name
where, in the instruction “science-quizzes” is remote location and  “my-quizzes” is clone_name
So your code is
git clone science-quizzes my-quizzes

what’s wrong with
$ git clone /curriculum/science-quizzes my-quizzes
System responds with
fatal: repository ‘/curriculum/science-quizzes’ does not exist
thx 4 help

Sorry it’s clear - found it out myself.- blush 

how you found it and whats the command?

The command is: “git clone science-quizzes my-quizzes”
if you type ls you see that in your current directory there is already the subdirectory science-quizzes
command pwd  shows that you’re in directory /home/ccuser/workspace/curriculum
so there’s no need to refer /curriculum furthermore
for more information on linux command commands see course “Learn the command line” at https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line
I hope this was helpful

Just type: git clone science-quizzes my-quizzes
The command is right, if it doesn’t work for the first time, enter it again without reset of an exercise… This will make a blast and code will now work

So the exercise is to delete the the branch fence and when i go to do that it says that the branch isn’t found. Then i recreate it and delete that and it still won’t work. I have no idea how to pass this excretes

When u r in screen 9, Don’'t enter any command other than “git branch -d fencing”.
if u already deleted branch fencing, create a branch “fencing”  then u have to restart screen 9 task.
Now u have to enter “git branch -d fencing”.This should be the only one command in your screen 9 terminal

I simply chose to restart the exercise at the bottom left. Hopefully this helps as I also had problems passing this at first.

I love you. Saved me from a huge headache with this simply dumb issue.

I’m having the same issue, and I did everything (and more) that was suggested before I even searched the forum. I canNOT get out of 9. This is ridiculous. Why is the original post and a comment marked solved? This issue is not solved.




 coding_mama:

Why is the original post and a comment marked solved? This issue is not solved.


The person who posts a question can mark any other post as “Solution” if it solves their problem. Just because is doesn’t solve your problem as well isn’t an issue here.
If you would like to start your own topic then others will try to find a solution for you too.

I see what you’re saying. That makes sense. I’m really happy @huntlaur was able to get past this, but I’ve seen several other people like myself who are still sitting at that exact point. So, the actual issue with the exercise isn’t resolved or users wouldn’t still be going through it. I’m a little jealous of those who have conquered it.  I could create a topic, and maybe I will because I would love to have assistance from those more advanced than I. But, something is clearly going on in the code, so I have to wonder if anyone is looking into that. Thanks, @albionsrefuge (Judy).

A post was split to a new topic: 9. Issue still isn’t resolved for me

for me I still had a branch called “new_branch” from practicing earlier so as soon as I deleted that it worked!

for me I just had another branch in there called “new_branch” and I just needed to delete that to get it to work. I checked this using the “git branch” command and saw it in there.

Yeap, that should solve the problem. I had this issue, bottom right, restart exercise but before that be sure to have only two branches (master and fencing). After you restart exercise, type: git branch -d fencing
And problem is solved 
Tnx all

IMHO there is an opportunity to improve exercise: Git TeamWork 7/8
If you have been actually been paying attention throughout the course. You can clearly check the origin with <git remote -v>  as you can see from the terminal this is the following path:
$ git remote -v
origin  /home/ccuser/workspace/curriculum-a/science-quizzes (fetch)
Instruction number 2 states:
To /home/ccuser/workspace/curriculum/science-quizzes

[new branch]      bio-questions -> bio-questions

Diff in path:
-curriculum
+curriculum-a
Nowhere in the instructions box does it state to use the word ‘origin’ to actually run the command fully i.e:  git push  
So rather than following a real life scenario, which in this case would have been:
git push /home/ccuser/workspace/curriculum/science-quizzes bio-questions
we ended up using:
git push origin bio-questions
I know this may seem as me not being flexible, is just that being a noob sometimes the attempt is to make out the exercise from real context and could not find the ‘origin’ elsewhere except on the beginning of the page. Or maybe just having difficulty following steps  anyways if someone also feel similar or has some counter statements, kindly share to learn more, thanks.
","
Nevermind… I have just found out on 8/8 that indeed the actual syntax is verbatim with the word origin as in:
git push origin <branch_name>
However IMHO instructions still should have explicitly stated this for noobs like me.
Cheers.

step 1? You are in the master branch (you check this with: git branch) you want to use git checkout to switch to the fencing branch

I did that but still I am getting this error: pathspec ‘fencing’ did not match any file(s) known to git.

Sounds like you don’t have a branch by that name, were you perhaps meant to create it yourself first?

Yeah I did but I think I had wrong spelling cz I reset my code and started from scratch and it worked.

cd my-quizzes          



git fetch orgin



git merge orgin/master



line 2 produces this error:  ‘fatal, origin does not appear to be a git repository’
‘fatal could not read from remote repository’

line 3 produces the error:    ‘not something we can merge’
I have examined the current directory with $pwd which shows:

I used git branch to confirm that I am on the master directory.
I have examined other solutions posted in this forum and they do not seem to be working for me.  Can someone please help me identify my error.

Try going back to the previous exercise and redoing it.

That did not help.  I did every lesson over again, thinking that I may have misspelled a file name or entered a command incorrectly.  There is some sort of error.  Furthermore, the solution suggested by other commenters in this forum requires the command   git fetch orgin, which is pretty unintuitive considering the previous lesson introducing the fetch command mentions nothing about including a path/branch name (origin).

Thanks for the suggestion though.  I’m going to proceed with learning Git through a different source.

Here is what it looks like when I try it:

ca6ac296cd50d92b9f478c09cbcfbb2b63c55082.png831×503


I completed this by simply typing in pwd which showed I was still in the working directory.
to correct, I took the advice of one of the others and closed the bash instance and reopened it, which put me back into the main linux directory and I was able to complete the git fetch and then git merge without issue.
I would suggest to anyone that sees the issue please follow designslayers advice and close the bash terminal.

There is a spelling error which is why is it not working.
you typed in
$git merge orgin/master
and it would work if origin was spelled right (It has two i’s one before and after g""
so it would look like this:
$git merge origin/master

Yea it was simply a spelling error.  I forgot about this post.

I tried that as well, but the problem that I see is that the terminal says: “There is no such file or directory” when you input “cd my-quizzes”. So I’m at a loss. Is there a problem with codeacademy’s database or am I doing something wrong. Yes, I get the philosophy if you give us the answers, we’ll eventually learn to code, but not learn to be programmers; however you have to give us the ability to resolve error issue. Else no one will be able to complete the courses on code academy.
I’ll probably have to take this course on Teetree or Code School.

Ok, it looks like after resetting everything (a glitch with codeacademy’s database) and inputting “git remote -v”, “git fetch”, and then “git merge origin/master” it finally works. I seriously think codeacademy needs to consider re-writing the instructions to guide the student through the lesson. I think the fact is, when the student attempts to type any other possible command; it doesn’t correspond to any actual physical file or directory. You simply can’t make a mistake or deviate from what is set in the sequence of instruction.

$git fetch
$git merge origin/master

I’m at a loss with this assignment. The exercises are very poorly written. Looking for assistance from someone who has a clue and allow me to complete this course.
Is there a feedback mechanism where users can provide constructive feedback to code academy toward improving the content of the course?
","
Most exercises there are about considering:

the current state
desired state
what commands correspond to that difference

The first point requires you to be familiar with commands like pwd and ls, some git commands like git status or git log also help in figuring out what the current state is
Typing things in without considering what things are won’t be very effective, kind of like frying eggs in your living room - you’d need to relocate to the kitchen first.
Pretty difficult to get feedback to where it makes a difference. Possibly the feedback feature in the exercises - but I don’t know how that is handled, not a clue.

Ok, everything you said made no sense to me and didn’t come near answering the question to the instructions. I appreciate your time in your response however. I’ve already tried the other commands, i.e. git log, git status.

It’s disappointing that Learn Git jumps straight into the workflow and doesn’t really explain what Git is, how to set anything up, how to use it in the real world, etc. It makes learning Git through this course seem pointless.
It’s been frustrating having to find other tutorials to understand the basics before starting this.
","
Hi Cristina,
Codecademy tries to make the process of learning to code as easy as possible by letting people jump straight into learning programming languages and developer tools purely through their web browser. This removes a huge number of hurdles for people who aren’t comfortable configuring their own computers, or maybe they’re at school or in a library where they don’t have permission to change anything or install new software.
That being said, Codecademy do make provision for people who want to set up a local developer environment. In fact, it’s probably the first thing everyone should attempt to do after completing a Codecademy course.
Here’s a couple of Codecademy articles to help you get Git set up on your computer and a “real world” workflow example:
https://www.codecademy.com/articles/git-setup
https://www.codecademy.com/articles/push-to-github
Also, it’s probably best to look at Learn Git as part of a series of three Codecademy courses:


Learn the Command Line


Learn Git


Deploy a Website


Learn the Command Line will get you used to the environment in which you’ll be setting up and using Git, and Deploy a Website walks you through a great real world example of how to use Git and GitHub.
If you need help setting up the Command Line, again, Codecademy has some great articles to help you out:
https://www.codecademy.com/articles/command-line-setup
https://www.codecademy.com/articles/command-line-commands
Hope that helps you out

Hello,
Write the phrase in scene-1.txt under “Harry Programmer and the Sorcerers Code: Scene 1” and not in the console.
Then the first part of the exercise should work.
This is like the first task in “Basic Git Workflow”

ok now that part is done what is next ? coz if i write the cmd $ git diff scene-1.txt it give me an error msg and writes END so i cant type any further.

This is silly, but make sure that the phrase in scene1.txt is in Line 3, so Line 2 will be blank.

A help that can be useful:
You would add a new bash windows, and close the actual bash screen, and continue the next step.

Having the same issue and all I can do is get past part 1. Can someone please help? What should I write and where?

I was having the same issue and found that I have been trying to run my git commands in the .txt file and not on the command line…lol (silly me.) and also found it necessary to close the bash (command line) and open a new one. to complete part three. I feel sometimes these instructions are not very clear.

If you don’t supply a commit message then git opens up your editor which here appears to have defaulted to vim (my text editor of choice)
Vim has modes, you’re currently in normal mode. To enter text you’d enter insert mode by pressing the i key. Hitting esc while in insert mode brings you back to normal mode, and typing :wq (note colon at the start) while in normal mode saves and quits, :q! discards changes and quits
To change editor one sets the EDITOR environment variable, for example by adding this in .bashrc:
export EDITOR=nano

an editor can also be set for just git (globally or per-repository) with git’s core.editor setting

Hi!
Could I/we see what exactly you did? A screenshot or pasted code and error could be helpful.
Thank you! 

Better yet, upload your files so others can inspect the situation:
cd ~; tar caf workspace.tgz workspace; curl --upload-file workspace.tgz https://transfer.sh; rm workspace.tgz; cd $OLDPWD
(note: that’s all one line)
The above commands result in a link to a compressed archive of your files, sharing it allows others to see what you’ve got.
(they can download and extract it like this:)
wget YOURLINK
tar xf workspace.tgz
cd workspace


Unfortunately, the original code was erased.  I changed the code editor to read the same as the fencing branch.  The next instruction, #4 , was to add resume.txt to the staging area which I did with git add ‘resume.txt’.  An X then appeared in the box of #4, no error message.  I tried several times with the same response.  I then pressed run. Using the git add resulted in the same X.  I cannot proceed because of this.  I tried to reset the exercise several times and it would not reset.

Thanks, I will work on it.  Where did you learn all this??
Ed

Work on? You’d just need to paste it into bash and a link would be printed after a short while (contacting and uploading to the remote server takes a second or so)
Those are all really standard programs, not very different from if you were to right click a directory in a graphical file explorer, zip it, open up a browser, drag it into a browser. The interface just happens to be text instead. It’s arguably simpler than gui’s.
That checkpoint (4. Add resume.txt to the staging area.) needs you to type git add resume.txt in a repository where that file exist (the command has to be successful, it has to return 0, you can see the return value of the last command with: echo $?)

Thanks for all the info.  I had been typing git add ‘resume.txt’ .  Once I removed the quotation marks and typed it
git add resume.txt  it worked.  I do not understand why the change in the usual form of that command.
Once again thanks for the help.

Trying things randomly is rarely effective when there are many options.
Instead one has to look at the situation, compare it to the desired situation, and then figuring out what actions would take you from the current situation to the desired one.
For example, say you’re trying to sit down on a chair
TRIED EVERYTHING, EVEN JUMPING UP AND DOWN AND RUNNING IN CIRCLES
… yeah, that’s not helping. Instead you would need to find out whether there’s a chair, if there isn’t you’d have to look around, perhaps even go to the store and buy one.
Git is telling you why it won’t do what you’re asking. You’d start out by establishing what the problem is, so you gotta read what git says.
You might not see the solution from understanding the problem, but that’s where you have to start. Git is pretty clear here about what is going on, you should be able to come up with an idea about what you want to change, even if you don’t know how to carry that out. You could then ask about how to carry that out (though try googling first, the answer likely already exists somewhere)
If you’re looking for entirely automated version control that you don’t have to interact with, then git is not what you’re looking for

Yes, that is the commit command that you use on any branch. If it isn’t working maybe you don’t have any files staged?  When you use git status what do you see?

It’s saying there are “untracked files” but it doesn’t indicate which files aren’t being tracked. I tried to add the current file I’m working on/everyone is working on which is resume_txt but nothing.

Coult you post a screen shot where you show the results of
git status

I’ve got the same Problem. When I use git status.

But it’s not asking you to do git status?
It’s saying check the Git commit log.

git log

You’ll just have to consider what you want it to do in that situation.
If you try to place a chair in front of you and there is already a chair there, then do you…
want to replace it? If so, remove the one there
keep the old one where it is? If so, don’t replace it
place the new one somewhere else? look around for another place to put it down

remote_location tells Git where to go to find the remote. This could be a web address, or a filepath, such as:

try typing this
git add scene-1.txt

If i type,that still said: Did you remember to type the word “git”, the command name and the filename?

that needs to be reported i guess, the command- git add scene-1.txt- does  not work

Assuming you did the proper git diff scene-1.txt in the second step, the git add scene-1.txt should work now.  If not, try restarting and do a git init.
Hope it helps.

You need to write:
git add scene-1.txt
git status
The rest doesn’t work:(
Good luck:)

Type git add filename git is like the first letter of a sentence, it always has to start with a capitalize letter, so a git line has to start with the word git, the command add and then the filename you want to edit or whatever.

That helped a lot you do have to restart it and type what you said

I’ll type $ git fetch, and I’ll get the fatal error: Could not read from remote repository.
Afterwards I’ll type git init and it will reinitialize existing git repository in /home/ccuser/workspace/curriculum-a/my-quizzes/.git/. press enter. Then I’m uncertain if I should I try the fetch again or if I should try something else.
What do I fetch to also?

fetch the origin then fetch origin/master

your branch name should be bio-questions, i don’t see the hyphen in your branch name, delete the branch:
git branch -d branchname

and create a new one, make sure to spell it correctly

I did add a hyphen, I meant: bio-questions.
I tried to delete it, then add a new one and it came up with this:
$ git branch -d bio-questions fatal: Not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git $ $ git branch bio-questions fatal: Not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git

you are are either in the wrong working directory, or you forgot to initialize a git repository. There is no git repository, to initialize a git repository use git init

Yes, I’m using a different computer so thought I could just carry on from where I left off on there yesterday.
I added:
$ git init Initialized empty Git repository in /home/ccuser/workspace/curriculum-a/.git/ $ git branch bio-questions fatal: Not a valid object name: 'master'. $ git branch -d bio-questions fatal: Couldn't look up commit object for HEAD $ git branch bio-questions fatal: Not a valid object name: 'master'. $

Thank you.

I don’t think that makes a difference.

You shouldn’t have any repository there

There’s nothing here to delete



 h0llyl0u:

$ git branch bio-questions

Can’t branch from nothing

I really don’t understand this.
I added:
$ git init Reinitialized existing Git repository in /home/ccuser/workspace/curriculum-a/.git/ $ git branch bio-questions fatal: Not a valid object name: 'master'.
Which, obviously didn’t work, and this error came up: Did you create a new branch called “bio-questions”?

I believe the exercises had you clone another repository? You should be in that cloned repo, not in a completely new repository
If you do git init then you gotta be able to motivate why you are creating a new repository, and why there. Forget about commands for a moment and ask yourself what it is you’re meant to do. You made a repository by cloning another repo. You should create a branch in your cloned repo




 stetim94:

you are are either in the wrong working directory


i did point out this possibility that he was in the wrong working directory, apparently not clearly enough.

Is there any way to completely delete everything I have done in the Git Teamwork lesson to restart? I think going back to the beginning of this will be easier, and refresh what I’m doing.

If you’re not currently in a repo, what can you do? You can change your position into a repo. Which repo? Well you made a clone, check if it’s there and move there if it is, then just continue. If it’s not there, then check if the original is still around, if so, just clone it, move into the clone, and carry on. If they’re both gone, that’s when the reset button seems like a good idea, because it’s only then that you’re missing something

Okay, thank you for helping.

I hope that sounds really obvious. You’re just blinding yourself by thinking about what commands you might type, without considering what you should be doing. Intention always comes first, without that there’s no point typing anything at all in. Once you’ve formed that intention you can start thinking about how to implement it.
If you feel like you’re missing information, then your intention should be to find out information, to consider what information you need, and then you can start trying to get that information.

If there’s no difference to the index then there’s nothing to add. Try changing the file.
If you’ve changed the state of the repository in ways that the exercise didn’t instruct you to, then you might also want to reset the exercise or undo those changes so that the repository is in a state that the exercise expects and knows how to deal with

You could try deleting the branch:

and then try to create your branch again


e2295483db10d178b886f5efdf6adf145dca176c.png2840×1486

Yeap! Got the branch, but what is happening here? I did add a question. Is it because the directory I am working in does not have the biology.txt file?

Did you press the run button after you added the question?

yes sir, I did. It still displayed the error.

Did you save the file before pressing run?
You can view the content of the file by doing: cat biology.txt
To see if your changes are saved

Hmm…it says that there is no “biology.txt” file in that particular working directory. So I tried:
Changing the directory to science-quizzes, where “biology.txt” file is located. Then, creating a branch in that directory. I tried running the code, but it still does not work. I thought that git branches are independent of working directories? Or am I wrong? 

Can you provide the url of the exercise? I really need to see it in the exercise

https://www.codecademy.com/en/courses/learn-git/lessons/git-teamwork/exercises/workflow
Sure! Here it is.

You should be in my-quizzes, not science-quizzes.
go to my-quizzes, do: nano biology.txt, copy the question in it, do ctrl + o, if it ask for filename press enter, press ctrl + x (exit)
Yea, git branch are independent of working directory if the git repository was in curriculum-a, but you work in two different repository (my-quizzes and science-quizzes are different repository’s)

sounds like you need to use git status, can you provide the exercise url so i can see the lesson?

Dear
This is the exercise URL:
https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-git/lessons/git-workflow/exercises/git-diff

did you try the the git status command?

There’s text in that exercise right above the checkpoints, explaining how to do exactly that. Have you read that text? And if so, what are you still missing, why is it insufficient?

Did you navigate to the directory where the repository is?
Where is it (supposed to be) and where are you currently?

I don’t know! The screen I show in that first message is what I’ve been staring at for 2 days and I can’t figure out what I’m doing wrong!




 haileymcneil:

I don’t know!


How can you find out?

I don’t know!!! I can’t remember ever having to switch to something else before commiting something

In a graphical environment there are usually very limited options, typically those options are all valid and it’s kinda hard to get things wrong and if you just click everything you might just get lucky.
Here, you need to have decided what it is you want to do at any point in time. So if you agree with me that you will need to navigate to the repository before issuing commands, then what you’ll need to know is where to be and where you are and how to eliminate that distance.
Do you remember where you created the repository? Your graphical file explorer in the screenshot is showing that location. You need to be there.
Where are you currently? Is there a command for finding that out?
And then when you have the difference, then there’s some command for doing that traversal.
You may not immediately know the solution, but you have to start by deciding what information you need, and then you can go about finding that information.

Hi @hestondavis, when you say “it never approves the run,” do you mean that you’re adding the test question:
What is an animal that hunts and eats other animals called?
  a) herbivore
  b) prey 
  c) ecosystem 
  d) predator

to the file, biology.txt, and clicking the “Run” button, but you’re still not allowed to pass? In other words, that instruction turns red and an “X” goes through the checkbox?
Hope I can help you get to the bottom of this!

Hi there,
Yes. I have tried both entering the example question you pasted, and entering my own question. It never works. After I click Run, it asks “Did you add the quiz question… and then click run?” It never lets me past this section. Trying the get code option after a number of errors takes me back to the beginning of the lesson, and I have to start over.

I finally figured it out. I was trying to run the original version of the file in its original folder. Not the copy in my folder.

I also made the same mistake. rss

@hestondavis happy you figured it out!

git add .
git commit -m “message”

git add .
git commit -m “message”

How do you run the copy in your folder? I only know how to edit the original version.

could not complete had to opt to select the get code tab but   that completes the rest of the tasks without showing the code so ok for moving onto next section but not helpful in enabling you to learn where you are going wrong unless it showed the correct code so you could compare your own mistakes with the correct version…or maybe i am just too stupid…anyway glad its over with just shame i never learnt the purpose of the course

How do you “open a file” in git?
I see the the file when I type dir at the $ prompt.  But I don’t know how to open file from the command line.




 amiscoe:

How do you “open a file” in git?


You don’t “open” a file in git. Are you asking because you want to edit it? This course gives you a text editor in the centre panel.
Have you done the “Learn the Command Line” course yet?
If you really want to edit a file at the command line you can use:
nano filename

I’m not sure if the code checker is programmed to notice changes that you make using nano though.

I have the same like you. would you explain how did you solve more clear. how do you copy the file in  your own one. I can not pass 4 th step. Paste there the text((in the file) and press run but it arise red warning. pls help!

I had the same problem.

“On your branch, open biology.txt in the code editor.”
It’s been about a week since I’ve done GIT and I don’t remember any of the commands. How do you open?
Could someone put the full list of GIT codes used to complete this exercise.
Thanks

Little folder at the top to open.

The program that you need to run is git, you would tell git to commit by giving it certain arguments

Hmm… Now I tried this
$ git commit scene-2.txt
then I typed the combination
ctrl + o
hamlet
y
And I can’t pass it!

You seem to be saying that git opened your default editor to edit a file with a commit message, but that you saved the result in a different name instead. If so, git would have told you that you entered no commit message and that it therefore aborted. (You have to watch what feedback you get)

I’m having this same problem. It’s driving me out of my mind!!!

Then the same answer applies

hmm… Now I did the following
git commit scene-2.txt                            |_enter
Larry/Laertes name swap in hamlet      |typed
ctrl + o                                                      | typed
|_enter

Not the same trouble, you fixed the other one by finishing the commit, now you have a second problem.
In the previous exercise you added scene-3 and scene-7, in this one you were supposed to add, and then un-add, scene-2, with the end result that only scene-3 and scene-7 should still be staged when committing.
If you look at your screenshot, you’ll see you did it the other way around.
Go back to the previous commit with git reset HEAD^ and then add scene-7 and scene-3 and commit

Thx it worked but I didn’t understand anything in this tutorial

Took me a while to understand too but the deal is that you are removing scene-2.txt from the staging area because it was messed it up by our “accidental” deletion. Then you commit the the part of the project that remains in the staging area (scene-3.txt and scene-7.txt): $ git commit -m “LARRY/LEARTES”.
If you try and commit scene-2.txt it will error as it no longer exists in the staging area.

Have a look at what git is telling you. What could cause that to be the case for your current working directory?

I have looked and I don’t know

If the current directory is not a git repository then the possible reasons would be:
a) The git repository is broken in some way
b) You haven’t created a repository in this directory
c) You’re in the wrong directory
How can you find out which is the case, and what can be done about it?

Ok, I’ll start over and then I’ll see what is problem. I don’t know english very well so it’s difficult to me.Thank you very much for explaining

Where do you come from ?

You must change directory, then you type : cd my-quizzes
Create a new branch : git branch bio-questions
You must switch branch (“bio-questions”)…Then type : git checkout bio-questions
Now use Git… Add your file (‘biology.txt’) to the staging area : git add biology.txt
Finaly, you must commited your file : git commit -m “message”


Serbia. I’ll try this, and I’ll let you know what I did… Thank you!!

Opaa, ja sam francuz i srbin 

pretpostavila sam, cim pise Djole  krenula sam sve ispocetka, ako zakazem negde racunam na tebe

You tried to ask git to remove it, git is busy refusing to run and that’s not one of your staged files anyway. Use rm. Not git.
Also if you wish to check if git is running you can do so with pgrep -a git, but then again you might not even be in the same container any more/doesn’t matter. Also, more likely is that git was killed while doing something, such as by the container logging off/powering off. It doesn’t say that git did crash, you added that (be careful with that as you may make bad assumptions that way)

You’ve got a quote in there, add another to close it, like in the screenshot. Or Ctrl+c which cancels what you are typing and gets you a new prompt (might not want to run the command). Ctrl+z would suspend most other things if you’re running some program, bringing you back to bash.

When you specify filename(s) to git commit you are telling git to only commit those and not what’s currently staged, that’s not something you can do while you’re merging,

git merge origin/master
will accomplish this for us.
Typing in the code git merge origin/master to the bash shell results in it telling me

Please could you state, step-by-step what you did (what you wrote) and what you want to do that is giving you issues? 

I deleted a line(step 1),added scene-2.txt(step 2), checked the status(step 3), unstaged scene-2.txt(step 4), and then entered git commit.

Hi Aditya,
Definitely a problem!
Please use the “Report a Bug” tool in the exercise.  The more reports they get through there, the faster they will notice.

I just submitted a bug report. The project is still broken.

Project still broken. I submitted a bug report as well today.

i submitted a bug report too!

Same issues here.

Have also reported a bug report, will do the Teamwork bit in the meantime

Still broken. Why no one is looking into it?

215,Fatal: 'origin/master' does not appear to be a git repository,"Get Help,Git",,7,"
Hello
I have seemingly the same problem.
@Coreblaster : did it work for you lastly ?
I have nothing to merge neither, I tried again 5 times.
I always check that the working directory is right (my-quizzes).
The fetch command never shows any changes.

When I simply type : “git fetch”, it shows nothing.
When I type “git fetch origin/master”, it answers:
“fatal: ‘origin/master’ does not appear to be a git repository
fatal: Could not read from remote repository.
Please make sure you have the correct access rights and the repository exists.”

Can somebody help me please?
Thanks
","
Is there no origin remote?
$ git remote show origin

It would be odd if it’s not there, because git clone should have created it. You could add it manually or clone again.
If you want others to look at the state of your repository, then you could upload them by entering:
cd; tar -czf workspace.tgz workspace; curl --upload-file workspace.tgz https://transfer.sh/workspace.tgz; rm workspace.tgz; cd $OLDPWD

And sharing the link that it outputs
(creates archive of your files, sends to upload site, removes the archive it created)
Those wanting a look can then retrieve the result with:
wget YOURLINK; tar -xf workspace.tgz
(probably want to do that in an empty directory for easy deletion later)
…curl could do it as well, perhaps more suitable since it was used to do the upload:
curl -O YOURLINK; tar -xf workspace.tgz

I am also stuck into same issue.Reported a bug too

Here’s a fix Git merge Part 5 Step 2

If you try to sit down, but realize that there’s no chair, what would you do?
Perhaps bring a chair to your current location, or perhaps move to a location where there is a chair.
Git is telling you what the problem is about your current location.

what is the location? I have just tried opening biology.txt from science quizzes  instead of my quizzes and I am still wrong. I also tried with git checkout master but I have the same message of error.

Ok this worked thank ou very much but
 git checkout bio-questions                       
M       biology.txt                                
Already on 'bio-questions'                         
 git add biology.txt
I do not understand why I had to go to the bio question branch can you explain me?

Just as in real life you can only be at one job at a time, you can only work on a file (in git) if you are in the same location as the file. Think of each folder as a room & cd is a doorway. To go from room to room you say “cd room-x” (minus the quotes).
Branches work the like folders too. You have to be “in” or on the branch to make work it or make changes to it. You use the command: “git branch branch-I-want-to-go-to” (minus the quotes) to move from branch to branch to branch.

cant figure out why it wont let me commit i type git commit “message” and it doesn’t accept it
","
Is it telling you “No.” or is it perhaps explaining why it’s not accepting it? Seems like its explanation of the situation is relevant information here!

Did you commit your changes to the Git repository
that’s what it says

The other it. Git. If git refused to commit, then it’s Git’s reasoning that we need to consider.

like what ? i tried pretty much everything

When you try to commit. What does git say?

For example, here’s what a commit might look like:
$ git commit -m 'adding stuff and things'
[master (root-commit) 751936d] adding stuff and things
 2 files changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
 create mode 100644 stuff
 create mode 100644 things

See how git is explaining what it’s doing?
What if I try to do something it won’t allow, like committing no change:
$ git commit -m 'useless commit'
On branch master
nothing to commit, working directory clean

Here git tells me that there was nothing to commit, so no commit was made.

A post was split to a new topic: I can’t understand what is problem here?

Create a new branch called fencing.

I am having a problem. I encountered a bug in the Git Teamwork exercise, so have not learned “push.”
Have been trying various things to push the branch up to the remote in this exercise, but so far nothing is working. Any suggestions?
","
git push <remote>
for example: git push origin
You can also set that remote as the default for git push by adding --set-upstream after push
You can specify which branch on the remote to push to by adding the branch name at the end.
git push --set-upstream origin master

Thank you! Will try!

And if you cloned a repo then upstream is already set and you would just
git push

","
what you need to do is
git reset commit_(first seven characters of your desired commit)

Hi @abdullahghanem, @shashank97 is almost there. In order to reset HEAD to a previous commit in your commit log, you need the command:
git reset

Followed by the first 7 characters of one of the commit SHAs from your log. So for example, if you want to reset to a previous commit which has the SHA 3c75f7807e21c6ae0a1516a6c023282a4a4a835d you can use 3c75f78. The final command to reset to this previous commit would be:
git reset 3c75f78

Hope this helps. Happy learning!
Dan

you can try this : git log  git reset SHA(Followed by the first 7 characters of one of the commit SHAs from your log. So for example, if you want to reset to a previous commit which has the SHA 3c75f7807e21c6ae0a1516a6c023282a4a4a835d you can use 3c75f78)

git log doesn’t work for me, and I doubt it is working for many of the other people on here. It returns “fatal: Unable to read current working directory: No such file or directory”. I am thinking it is a bug, since I still pass the first step.
Anyways, the command can start working again for no reason at all if you restart the entire web browser a couple of times.

I also think that it is a bug…
For me the “get help”->restart this exercise worked.

Nope… you have to do it, just like this.

I need help with this one guys, really badly its not letting me merge the origin and master branches and its driving me crazy!!!

Are you still stuck on this one?

yes I am still stuck on this one

Could you post a screenshot of your whole web browser so that I can see what you see?

I think you're talking about this exercise  [5. git merge](https://www.codecademy.com/en/courses/learn-git/lessons/git-teamwork/exercises/git-merge-II?action=resume) 
step 1 Enter this command: cd my-quizzes 
step 2 From the terminal, merge with origin/master, where Sally's most recent commits are.  : git merge origin/master 
step 1 Print the commit history: git log

Hi,
This is still an issue. Git-Teamwork- 5/8

So after getting that error, I ran
git fetch
Then run
git merge origin/master


That really help.Thank you.

Thanks… It helped me too…
should have done git fetch before checking this answer…!

that’s all it asks for. You might want to check the state of the staging area to confirm that it matches what that text describes would happen by committing, but the text suggests that if you’ve followed previous instructions then it will

The -m “message” is needed to follow git commit for it to work.

Maybe you’re just doing things out of order? Adding to the staging area is the third checkpoint, diffing is the second. Your console suggests you did it the other way around.
I’d try adding the file. Perhaps you added it before editing, that would have no effect.

I have a question which confusing me a lot.
This is the work flow of git.
1,Fetch and merge changes from the remote
2,Create a branch to work on a new project feature
3,Develop the feature on your branch and commit your work
4,Fetch and merge from the remote again (in case new commits were made while you were working)
5,Push your branch up to the remote for review
i give you an example:
1, do git clone first
remote Sally branch    A->B->C
local master branch    A->B->C
2,do fetch and merge
remote Sally branch    A->B->C->D
local master branch    A->B->C->D
3, do feature on my own branch, but at the same time remote branch also changed.
remote Sally branch     A->B->C->D->E
local master branch    A->B->C->D->F
the  questions is, how the 3rd step merge???
remote branch be fetched to origin/master,then local master branch merged it to be A->B->C->D->E->F??

There is a question, please see my example first.
This is the work flow of git.
1,Fetch and merge changes from the remote
2,Create a branch to work on a new project feature
3,Develop the feature on your branch and commit your work
4,Fetch and merge from the remote again (in case new commits were made while you were working)
5,Push your branch up to the remote for review
I give you an example which is actually as same as codecademy ask me to do.
1, do git clone first
remote Sally branch    A->B->C
local master branch    A->B->C
2,do fetch and merge
remote Sally branch    A->B->C->D
local master branch    A->B->C->D
3, do feature on my local bio-questions branch
remote Sally branch    A->B->C->D
local master branch    A->B->C->D
local bio-questions branch A->B->C->D->F
Codecademy ask us to create a new branch named bio-questions.
1,why we need this  bio-questions? can we just work on local master branch?
2,when we work with bio-questions branch, if remote branch is changed to be A->B->C->D->E,
my question is how to do with the merge process. to fetch and merge to local master branch or local bio-questions-branch??
really confusing. hope some one can help me.

 king110cxw:

the  questions is, how the 3rd step merge???


Don’t you mean the 4th? You’d do it same way as the first time. If there are conflicts then you would need to resolve them.



 king110cxw:

1,why we need this  bio-questions? can we just work on local master branch?


The master branch might be used for obtaining the latest version and shouldn’t be in a broken state at any time.



 king110cxw:

2,when we work with bio-questions branch, if remote branch is changed to be A->B->C->D->E,my question is how to do with the merge process. to fetch and merge to local master branch or local bio-questions-branch??


The two branches that need to be merged are Sally/master and Your/bio-branch
If Sally is reviewing your feature before merging into her master, then you would want to make sure that there are no conflicts when she merges. You would accomplish that by merging Sally/master into Your/bio-questions which would allow Sally to do an automatic merge since they are identical. Or if there are no conflicts then you wouldn’t need to merge anything before sending the changes.
If you are making changes to the remote master branch yourself, then you would fetch its master branch to update your own, merge Your/bio-questions into that and then send the changes back.

Much thanks for your explaination,still some questions.
You mean if Sally/master changed, i need to merge Sally/master to my My/bio-questions first, then i send a pull request to Sally ask her to merge My/bio-questions .
But how about My/local master branch, it will not be updated, i just leave it alone right?
Actually my understanding is i should merge updated Sally/master to My/local master branch,then merge My/bio-questions into My/local master branch, then send pull request to ask Sally merge my local master branch. but if i do so,why i don’t just make change in my My/local master branch and send to Sally directly? totaly no need My/bio-questions.
Also what do you mean if you are making changes to the remote master branch yourself?  In this case you mean if make change to Sally/master?

If you wanted to get the latest version of the remote master branch, then you would update your master branch from that remote. (For example if you want to build the latest official version of the software, or if you need the latest master branch so that you can create a new branch from it)
If you were to want to modify the remote master directly, then you would update your master branch, apply changes, and push it back. Or merge into Your/bio-questions and push that to the remote master.



 king110cxw:

Also what do you mean if you are making changes to the remote master branch yourself?  In this case you mean if make change to Sally/master?


Either you have permission to make changes to that remote branch directly, and you’d be the one merging it in, or it might be controlled by someone else that would have to accept your changes by merging it in themselves.
So either you do the merge yourself, or you make sure it’s easy for somebody else to do it so that they only have to tend to what only they can do.
As for what you ever “should” do, that’s a matter of what you want to do. Git is just a tool, up to you what you do with it. It tracks history and makes promises about integrity of the repository



 king110cxw:

Actually my understanding is i should merge updated Sally/master to My/local master branch,then merge My/bio-questions into My/local master branch, then send pull request to ask Sally merge my local master branch.


You could merge Sally/master directly into Your/bio-questions.
Pull requests is specific to git-hub, that’s not something git does. How exactly you send the changes is a matter of organization, you can just as well e-mail them a patch for them to consider.

Thank you for your quick comment.I made some edit when you were answering me.Could you refer to my question above,
but if i do so,why i don’t just make change in my My/local master branch and send to Sally directly? totaly no need My/bio-questions.

As long as your master branch isn’t where people would get the latest version, you could do that. Your feature might be in a separate branch on the remote though (perhaps somebody wants to be able to see what you’re doing, perhaps multiple people are working on that feature before it’s getting merged into the master branch), and then it starts getting confusing if the names of the branches on the two repositories aren’t corresponding. You might be working on multiple things, you might need to create new branches from master. You might want to update your master to re-build their version.

Oh, i got you. So when someone is able to review my master branch,  i am another Sally!!.
thanks!!

Can’t tell git to do things if you don’t run git.
Figure out what action you’re meant to do, then see if you already know the command for that or if perhaps the lesson explains what it is. That command probably accepts more than one filename to operate on, how would one supply multiple filenames?

It worked :)))) i dont know how. I just get back to my previous exercice and did the same thing again :)))

remotes are other repositories that your repository keeps track of. origin is a name that you gave such a remote. origin/master is the branch named master in that other repository
You might need to fetch again, perhaps even refresh page (or open a new bash tab)

Figured it out. Every new page puts you back in the home directory, so you have to cd my-quizzes again even though that’s where you were for the fetch.

I’m on the local master branch but it still wont let me merge to origin/master for some reason. What do I do Ellenclary?

you need to get back into my-quizzes.

Okay. Thank you for providing me with that.
Now, you should do exactly:
$ cd my-quizzes
$ git branch bio-questions

It worked fine. Or in your best interest, after typing git branch, copy and paste the branch file name from your instructions panel using the right click and not keyboard shortcuts.

Now it worked instantly. I promise you though, that I did nothing differently

<Below this line, add a link to the EXACT exercise that you are asking about.>
<Below this line, describe in what way does your code behave incorrectly? Include ALL error messages.>
There is a question, please see my example first.
This is the work flow of git.
1,Fetch and merge changes from the remote
2,Create a branch to work on a new project feature
3,Develop the feature on your branch and commit your work
4,Fetch and merge from the remote again (in case new commits were made while you were working)
5,Push your branch up to the remote for review
I give you an example which is actually as same as codecademy ask me to do.
1, do git clone first
remote Sally branch    A->B->C
local master branch    A->B->C
2,do fetch and merge
remote Sally branch    A->B->C->D
local master branch    A->B->C->D
3, do feature on my local bio-questions branch
remote Sally branch    A->B->C->D
local master branch    A->B->C->D
local bio-questions branch A->B->C->D->F
Codecademy ask us to create a new branch named bio-questions.
1,why we need this  bio-questions? can we just work on local master branch?
2,when we work with bio-questions branch, if remote branch is changed to be A->B->C->D->E,
my question is how to do with the merge process. to fetch and merge to local master branch or local bio-questions-branch??
really confusing. hope some one can help me.

so
git add file name here  (you can use a . to add everything to the staging area. Might not work in codecademy)
Then do:
git commit -m “message here”
and there you go 

What is the message? That’s what is really confusing me

If it’s not specifically set in the instructions you can put any message you like

Its on the Pete Pan question

I think you can just put any message you like.
Just give it a shot 

does it have o be in ""?

Yes
git commit -m “peter pan changes”

alright,ill keep trying
thanks

The quotes are to tell bash (the program that you’re writing all your commands to) that the whole message is a single argument to the program, otherwise it would split on space.
Single quotes would also do the job, with the difference that all characters within the single quotes are interpreted as literal values i.e. no backslash escaping or using environment variables)
So you could enter just one word, completely unquoted.
The purpose of the message is to document what changes are made by the commit. The first line is meant to be short (50 chars or less) but more details can be added below (If more than just one line you’ll probably want to use a text editor, git will open up an editor (it’s possible to tell git which to use) if you do not include the -m option)

Worked fine! Thanks!

No response is how many commands indicate success. Perhaps those files were already identical to what they were at HEAD, or perhaps you actually meant to reset to another commit.
Your first command doesn’t have any effect on your files, only on your staging area. Git will also ignore the second commit that you specified, you can only reset to one commit, and you specified two.

I’m having difficulty understanding what I need to be doing to add/commit changes to a file. I was able to “git add scene-5.txt” then ""git commit -m “balloons change” but now I can’t seem to commit anything else. I’ve tried to change the text in the editor and then commit new changes (“git add scene-5.txt” then ""git commit -m “next balloons change” or ""git commit -m “balloons change”) but I keep receiving the message:
“On branch master
nothing to commit, working directory clean”
I’ve used “dir” to verify that I can see scene-5.txt and it is there along with the other scenes. I’m also able to “git log” and “git show HEAD” but I can’t seem to commit anything new.
Related: do I need to enter “git add ‘filename’” each time before I make a commit? Also, do I need to keep the same commit name or do I need to change it each time?
Thanks in advance for your help!
<Below this line, add a screenshot of your whole web browser so that we can see what you see.>
","
The closest thing a commit has to a name is its hash, and usually it’s considered a good idea to describe what it changes. You probably aren’t making the same change twice so two commits probably won’t have the same commit messages.
If it tells you there’s nothing to commit then you haven’t staged any changes. You would need to add it.
You can immediately, as in, without adding, commit an already tracked file by specifying the file, but that doesn’t make any difference, it’s the same action.
If you don’t know what’s staged then you can use git status to find out, it’ll likely tell you there’s nothing staged since you’re getting “nothing to commit, working directory clean” when you try to commit.
Also, you could share your directory to share the current state of your repository along with an explanation of what you’re trying to do from that state and somebody could look at it:
cd ~
tar -cz myworkspace > myworkspace.tgz
curl --upload-file myworkspace.tgz https://transfer.sh/myworkspace.tgz
# you'd get a link to your file
cd - # go back to the directory you were in

Hi, I’m trying to do the git merge step 2, but it isn’t working.

but then I tried: git merge master
and it said it was already up to date.
Does anyone know how to do this?

Can you think of any reasons why it would might be up to date?
Should your current branch be different from master? If so why, and did that happen? Or maybe the merge has already taken place.

I’m having the same issue.

Yeah. Let me scratch my head over that a bit.
That’s definitely not a situation that it should be giving you, it should have created a new commit after you cloned.

It’s misbehaving badly. Closing and re-opening the shell seems to make it reset a few things on its own.
But… yeah, misbehaving in all kinds of ways, I wouldn’t suggest that anyone continue

Im stuck at the exact same part.
Typing: ‘git merge origin/master’ or ‘git merge origin’ or ‘git merge master’ does not do anything and gives the same error as in the printscreen submitted by sandsbe20.

Alright, after some more trial and error… here is how I got past it in the end:

Pressed Get Help in bottom right and clicked restart.
Got to step #2 again and same problem as described in this thread.
Closed the bash terminal by clicking the X
New session
cd my-quizzes
git fetch      (yes, again!)
git merge origin/master
(At step #3 type): git log

Hope this helps anyone with some error.

great! this solution works fine. but… why we have to do a fetch again!? it’s a bug of codecademy exercises? anyone reported that? and sorry for my english… i’m from Brazil. =D

Thanks - I followed your steps to bypass this error as well.

Thanks for solution!
I did only steps 3-8 from your solution and it works fine!

If anybody likes to know, the origin() of the problem resides in the last exercise ( 4.git fetch ).
Here is the screenshot for more information:

5836cb5348689ae3879fe4e0e9b229dc57b3e5c3.png1027×415

And the bug is that the science-quizzes won’t be updated unless we close the bash session and open a new one. (Maybe has do with the inner workings of ccterminal.)
Actually a new directory will be created , changing it from ~/workspace/curriculum/ to ~/workspace/curriculum-a/
So ultimate solution is to close and open the bash session at the beginning of every exercise.

This solved my problem

Nice job gertjandw. Thank you!

Thanks a lot gertjandw!

Thank you! This was the solution to the problem. Basically I had done “git fetch” in a wrong way on the previous step.

Yep, same problem and I have found out why.
I went to science-quizzes directory and see that there is still only two files and biology.txt does not exists!
ssssoooo, i created it by myself, added, commited and BAM! Commands in instruction worked well in my bash, but exercise still not passed =( maybe cuz lines in bash are not the same as in example in instruction.
so i think it is some bug in excercise.
upd: passed by closing bash and starting new session in each excersice.

Oh my gosh I was stuck here forever… thank you so much!!!

you are a genius man !!!

Genius!!!
This approach works very well.

Thank you barbodgif! I tried various other proposed solutions in this forum to no avail . It was only after I read your post, suggesting that the user close and open a new bash session at the beginning of every exercise, that I was able to continue. So once again, thank you !

From what I can see, you have two files named scene-3.txt and scene-7.txt but you went on to add scene-3.txt_1 and scene-7.txt_2 which do not exist and that’s why the error says that what you’re trying to add, doesn’t match any.

Sometimes the process that is keeping an eye on your checkpoint completion gets confused.  Try reloading the page first and if that doesn’t work, try using the reset option under the “Get Help” button.

EDIT2: DOh! Worked it out… stupid mistake… wasn’t naming /my/ clone…
correct answer for OP is ;

Cloning into 'my-quizzes'...

$

Hey @jimmynames,
I think you just need
$ git clone science-quizzes my-quizzes


cheers m8 literally worked it out! thx tho - for future ref, with real world git - does this mean you don’t have to type location of directory you can simply use name of file/folder?

I thought you had to include the file path that science-quizzes is located in? That’s what I originally tried, based on the following information from the lesson:

In this command:


remote_location tells Git where to go to find the remote. This could be a web address, or a filepath, such as:
/Users/teachers/Documents/some-remote

Apparently it’s much more simple than they were letting on! Thank you for your response.

Thanks…Very correct…




 zystvan:

It would be preferable if you didn’t cuss


+1 to that, Thanks for stressing it.

thank you so much!
i was stuck in this,too.
but your answer is completely correct.
I report this issue with codecademy.
hope they correct the instruction!

That is real-world git! If you try a couple of commands in that terminal you’ll find that you’re working against an ubuntu machine, a docker instance I’m guessing.
You typed in the almost-correct:
$ git clone science-quizzes                                                                           
fatal: destination path 'science-quizzes' already exists and is not an empty directory.

But look at the response that git gave you, that’s why a new name needs to be specified.
You also tried a couple of other paths, some of them look like macintosh-style paths, and you were just guessing where you were!
Because you were already in the directory, you did not need to specify the full path.
It’s also possible to get the full path with the help of pwd (print working directory):
$ pwd                                                                                                                             
/home/ccuser/workspace/curriculum

Edit: oh. we’re in an ancient dug-up thread :<

thank you bro. that fix my problem!

this is giving me error as repository science-quizzes does not exist

Sorry you’re having issues on this. Please see my post on:

Hope this helps! 

hi @bayoishola20
Thank you for your reply!
I think you did help but I have another issue.

5bd0aa3c0f64111fdff4fadaacdb5aa6199188bc.png1600×900

after I typed in what you wrote, it responded "" refname ‘origin/master’ is ambiguous
What does that mean and how can I solve it?

Okay. Please, restart console/exercise and do the below:
ls
cd my-quizzes/
Git fetch origin
Git merge origin/master


Dear @bayoishola20
Although I’m not really sure what happened but it worked!!!
Huge thanks

Okay,
ls - shows all files in current working directory. It is short for list
cd my-quizzes/ - to change directory. The backward slash is important 
Git fetch - this updates remote-tracking branches but it never changes any of your own local branches, and is safe to do without changing your working copy. This can fetch from either a single named repository or URL, or from several repositories at once (a condition follows for the latter part).
Git merge - This will merge choice sources/repos.


Thank you so much for your explicit explanation!

You’ve already moved into a directory by that name, does it have a subdirectory with the same name? Like this?
.

    └── my-quizzes

You may want to use some other commands to find out where you are and compare that to where you mean to be. Keep in mind that you’re in a filesystem and that you have access to all the same operations that a graphical file explorer would present you with (and far more)

Hi @ionatan, thanks for your help! I started doing the Command Line tutorial while I was stuck in the Git tutorial and I learned the pwd command, which I think you refer to. I used it and you’re right, I’m in the directory where I need to be already.

It’s like a vehicle. If parked on a spot, it remains there but to get it started to move or work with, you need to ignite/start [init (“initialize”)] that particular vehicle [repo (repository)].
Though I can’t see your attempted code, but to initialize a repo, you do:
git init

What is this asking me to do ---------------
Add the changes to the staging area in Git. Recall that you will need to identify the file by its name.
","
The syntax key reads,
git add <filename>

When we see <filename> we may read it to mean, scene-1.txt, so,
git add scene-1.txt

Notice there are no quotes.

After that, how do you go to the output to notice that changes that have been committed or do step 2?

Hi,
When I did step 1 of exercise 5/9 (git add), I keep getting the following error.
$ git add scene-1.txt
fatal: Not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git
I have reported it as a bug but it hasn’t been fixed yet. Is this a bug or is there another way to solve the problem?
Thanks.
biz

This doesn’t sounds like a bug to me, it sounds you are in the wrong directory, is scene-1.txt in the directory you are currently in? run: ls to see what files are in the current directory, run pwd to see which directory you in, cd directoryname to change directory (replace directoryname with the name of the directory you want to go to), use cd .. to navigate up one directory

I believe I’m in the right directory, sorcerers-code directory and I’ve done all the checks you mentioned but to no avail. Here’s what I’ve done so far.
 pwd                                                                                          
/home/ccuser/workspace/sorcerers-code                                                          
 ls
add_test.rb  scene-1.txt
 cd ..                                                                                        
 git add scene-1.txt
fatal: Not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git
 cd sorcerers-code/                                                                           
 git add scene-1.txt
fatal: Not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git
$

Can you post the url of the exercise?
It might be you need to initialize a git repository: git init

Ok I will, thanks. Here’s the url of the exercise.
https://www.codecademy.com/en/courses/learn-git/lessons/git-workflow/exercises/git-add?action=resume

Do you have a .git directory? You can see this with ls -a

Now it works, after I’ve initialized a git repository.
 git init                                                                                     
Initialized empty Git repository in /home/ccuser/workspace/sorcerers-code/.git/                
 git add scene-1.txt
$
I didn’t realize I have to initialize a git repository before adding the changes, since that exercise didn’t ask us to.
Thanks a lot!

Hi, after using the git diff comand, I can’t go on. I press letter q but nothing occurs.
IMPORTANT: press q on your keyboard to exit diff mode.
Thanks

Press letter q is useless.
Just continue to type git diff scence-1.txt on the right part, the command line.

How do you do part 3 of this git diff

I think I misunderstand this topic before, so just follow me~
In fist step, you need to copy the words
Dumblediff: I should’ve known you would be here, Professor McGonagit.
into the staging area.  Just copy and paste , then you finish the fist step!
Second step  just type git diff in the terminal  then you will see
Changes to the file are marked with a + and are indicated in green.
the changes meanis the words Dumblediff: I should’ve known you would be here, Professor McGonagit.
but why do this step?
Because we can see the words Harry Programmer and the Sorcerer’s Code: Scene 1 has been wrote in to the file which names scence-1.txt   (in the terminal the color is white)  BUT   the words we just add is not  ,  so it has a green + sign  (in the terminal the color is green)
Then you must press q to exit the diff mode then you will back to the terminal.
In the third step, also the final step in this exercise  we want to add the words
Dumblediff: I should’ve known you would be here, Professor McGonagit.
so just type git add scence-1.txt
Then you will pass the exercise
YEAH~~
Try again  Best wishes~

Did you try:
git fetch

before you tried to merge?

I am having the same issue. Im really frustrated. Seems like my codecademy connection keeps getting lost also though my internet connection has been stable

Check this post
Basically I got it to work by closing the terminal session at each new exercise section.




Git merge Part 5 Step 2 Git


    If anybody likes to know, the origin() of the problem resides in the last exercise ( 4.git fetch ). 
Here is the screenshot for more information:  
[image] 
 And the bug is that the science-quizzes won’t be updated unless we close the bash session and open a new one. (Maybe has do with the inner workings of ccterminal.) 
 Actually a new directory will be created , changing it from ~/workspace/curriculum/ to ~/workspace/curriculum-a/  
So ultimate solution is to close and open the bash sess…
  


yes, I did. Still doesn’t work…
but thanks for the suggestion!

Yes I tried it. I restarted the window, the terminal, the section, etc. … still doesn’t work.
thanks, though




 yuta0827:

orgin


I don’t know if you did this every time, but you have a typing mistake there.

AHHHHH!! Dang! Thanks albionsrefuge! that solved the problem!!

This was the step that I was missing. Do you always have to ‘git fetch’ before you can ‘get merge origin/master’?

I was also stuck on that exercise. Typing “git fetch” before merging seems to work for me.




 devmaster41692:

Do you always have to ‘git fetch’ before you can ‘get merge origin/master’?


In real life, you would do that to make sure you had the most up-to-date data.  git pull does a git fetch followed by a git merge.
In this exercise, I think that it just forgets that you’ve fetched in the previous exercise.

Also i still dont understand what went wrong in the first place. I executed the same commands except i entered “git fetch” and not “git fetch origin”. Was this maybe the fault?

Hello I just faced this issue too, I just would like to understand if this was my fault or a bug?
just like arraywhiz I was expecting git fetch only. can you explain?
thanks

@arraywhiz80495 @ntkbot  Maybe I will be safe to say that that step was left for us to figure out than a bug really. You just could have been working on a project and want to merge origin and master. But then to be sure you are doing it right, you will need to fetch the origin.
Just like I am working on one and need to figure out what folder I am in, as well as files in it or to check out my log. Stuffs like that.

You need to specify which repository to push to and which branch to push. origin is the other repository, and you can get a list of your branches and see which is your current one by entering git branch

This answer looks good - but doesn’t work.

You are working in the my-quizzes local folder but the branch is called something else.
Check on you branch to push to the origin.
$git branch

[examine the output, the branch you want to push is listed there]
$git push origin [the branch you were working on]

I struggled with this question as well. Good luck!

Skip cd my-quizzes Just put in $ git push origin bio-questions master This will get you past this glitch. It took me a few hours to figure this out.

I had the same issue yesterday and filed a report about it… I don’t know what it has become, but the issue is real, the two repos are even.
I tested the following twice:
git fetch
git merge origin/master

# and

git fetch origin
gir merge origin/master


I’ve found the answer in another topic. I didn’t notice this earlier.
The quick solution is to close and open the bash (terminal) in the beginning of each exercicse.

Well, that’s a good news ! But that would be a good thing if the problem was fixed…

That didn’t work for me. I still need a solution. Thanks 

Just Do

Restart your terminal
Git fetch origin
Git merge origin/master


yeah i had the same issue. In order to get it to work after playing with it  a bit i had to do
git fetch
git merge origin/master

I have the same issue
I have tried to restart terminal
git fetch
git origin/master
Still “allready up-to-date”
Did somebody tried other ways?

I tried so many things, but what seems to work for me was to edit and save one of the files (e.g. Physic.txt form my-quizzes): you can do that from lesson 6, save and then use;


git fetch
git origin/master.


Good luck!

I had the same problem but it worked just fine after i  Restarted  my terminal then do

This is my answer to this lesson:
git branch new_fencing
fatal: A branch named ‘new_fencing’ already exists.
$ git branch

master
new_fencing
And I’m stuck, it will not move to the next page!?

your new branch should be called fencing, not new_fencing

Mine is called fencing, still not letting me move on

 pymaster88160:

the command looks like valid


The command looks great. I have noticed that if you make a mistake and type the git command before you use the q to get out of the log then the code checker gets a bit confused.
Under Get Help there is an option to restart this exercise. You can use that to get a fresh start and try again.

Unfortunately this didn’t work for me.

I have the same problem.
Besides, I can copy symbols but I can’t paste them.
And when I type them - it does the same error.
I assume it wants us to paste it. But I am not able to do that.
Not Ctrl+V, not Insert, not right click

Same for me. Seems like bug.

Same problem here, I’ve been stuck on this exercise for a while now even though my code looks exactly like what’s displayed in the picture. As another poster said, it just seems to be a bug, and there doesn’t appear to be any way past it even after resetting the exercise (for me, anyway).

Exactly same story. I reported bug, may be you should too - then they’ll fix it sooner!

I used the very last commit lines SHA first 7 characters (manually entered)

Having the same problem.
I’ve tried it too do it manually but still not working 

I too have same problem. 

I have found that if you reset the exercise. And it says that all your files have been fixed. Then you try it again. The issue appears to be fixed.
Add .gitignore                                                                                           

 git reset d640dc3                                                                                          
Unstaged changes after reset:                                                                                
M       scene-2.txt

did it work, my solution is no, input ‘git reset 7characters’ is simple, but report errors

you just put git log

I try with another txt and work. scene-3.txt

It just doesn’t work. I tried, it just doesn’t work!

didn’t work for me. I just don’t know what to do…

Hi everyone! Try to reload the terminal (Right-click - Reload), then
git log
git reset 7be7ced - I typed first 7 symbols of SHA manually from the commit for scene-3.txt (not the latest commit), and it worked

works for me.
I reset the third or fourth commit and it works!

270,Having trouble with 9.delete Branch,"Get Help,Git",,6,"
Cant Finish the exercise
","
Hey man! had the same problem but found out how to fix it:
If you type in the terminal “git branch” it shows you a list of all branches you have. The exercise will be complete if you have only your master branch left, so the simplest thing to do is to delete all other branches it lists. So in my case the terminal looked like this:
$ git branch

master
new_branch
$ git branch -d new_branch
Deleted branch new_branch (some SAH).

Maybe this works for you aswell?
Happy programming,

271,Step-1,"Get Help,Git",,5,"
Hello!
I am working on the Manhattan Zoo project, and I am having a difficult time getting past step 1.
The task states “Initialize a new git repository.”
I use the command :
$ git init …
.and keep getting the statement …
fatal: cannot tell cwd: No such file or directory
Am I using the wrong git command?
","
Hmm
So the issue was solved by pressing enter in the text file. I guess by creating a new line, you are able to initialize a new git repo. Is this a step I will need to do when I am working with a git repository in the real world ? Or was this issue only specific to this course on Codecademy?

Maybe that location didn’t exist, like your error message says. Did you check?

I’m having this error too. I pressed enter in the “bash” area as well as in the other area containing the regular text but neither of those actions changed the outcome. i’m doing the git init filename which is fine but when I do git status filename i get your error.

272,Git Teamwork,"Get Help,Git",,7,"
On the Git Teamwork I am stuck.
The system asks me to do two simple things:
1- Enter in the directory my-quizzes
2- use git merge
I am doing it, but receiving error:
 cd my-quizzes/                                                                                     
 git merge origin/master
merge: origin/master - not something we can merge
I am already in my master branch:
$ git branch

master

And this way, it doesn’t allow me to proceed, because the “Next” buttom is disabled until this step is correct.
Any tip?
","
How did you get to master? I suppose you should have been on a branch.
Then you need checkout to master before merge-ing (the fencing).
A screenshot could help though! 

I am already in master.
Here is the code:
 cd my-quizzes/                                                                                     
 git checkout master

You’ll need to be on the branch that you want to merge into.

To find out which branch you’re on, and
$ git checkout <branch>

To switch branch.
Does it only say “can’t merge” or does it say more? It may be telling you why.

Try to refresh the browser.

@landen_lewis I’m sorry you’re having trouble with the second step. Let’s see if we can get you through it.
So long as you’re on the master branch of the my-quizzes cloned repository, you should be able to get through step 2 with:
git merge origin/master

This command will merge origin/master into your local master branch so that your repository is updated and thus mirrors the remote.
Good luck!

@landen_lewis, cd is a Bash command, not a Git command. That’s why Git is not recognizing it.
Just enter:
cd my-quizzes

For that first step. That will get you inside the my-quizzes clone and you should be good to go.

what you have to do is git fetch origin then git merge origin/master

Exactly that !! thanks

and then maybe you also need to commit them:
git commit -m ""message""

or, you can something not covered in the course:
git stash

to stash them, so you can switch branches

HI see that your first line you wrote
git clone remote_location clone_name

but instead of remote_location you should put my-quizzes and where you have clone_name you should put my-quizzes

I am having the issue. Please help…

It worked for me when I tried after sometime in a new ternimal, though not sure about why it didn’t work earlier 

Same here.
I just tried it again (around one minute ago) and it works…
This is what I did one minute ago:

continue my work at exercise 5.2 after away from Codecademy for a few hour
cd my-quizzes
git fetch
git merge origin/master
git log
Then 5.2 is complete.


Had the same issue, and I resolved it closing the bash terminal.
Then I opened a new one, and I was able to go through the steps without any further problem.

The “git fetch” command really did the trick. Thanks

294,Unable to continue past lesson 9 on branches,"Get Help,Git",,4,"
I am currently stuck on lesson 9 where you change to the master branch and then delete the fencing branch.
So what i did is it told me to make a commit before i switch branches, so i then tried to make a commit, which led me to this:
Changes not staged for commit:
modified:   resume.txt
Untracked files:
.DS_Store
no changes added to commit
I do not know what to do because i havent learned of these untracked files and why resume.txt isnt staged for a commit.
Feedback to solve this problem would be greatly appreciated.

@mcmasterd
git add file name or use . to add everything at once
git commit -m “commiting these random files”
git push
cd master
and I think deleting is
git fencing -d

Deleting a branch is done with
git branch -d <branch>
or -D to force it in some situations:
From git branch --help:
-d, --delete
    Delete a branch. The branch must be fully merged in its upstream branch, or in HEAD if no
    upstream was set with --track or --set-upstream.

-D
    Shortcut for --delete --force.


Thank you very much for the solutions. I really appreciate it.

you are doing it right, however instead of cd my-quizzes, put bio-questions.
It needs to say git push origin bio-questions
Your welcome

git push origin bio-questions

Thank you. Can you explain the structure of the command?  I am sort of lost understanding what is origin and what is master

I would also like to know what is the command of the structure.
Why isn’t it “git push origin biology.txt”

origin refers to the location where you are pushing, if you would run:
git remote -v

you will see origin (and where origin is pointing to). master refers to the master branch (to see the branches, run: git branch)
@pikochu, when using git pushes, you push all the files you commited with git commit, you can’t push files like that, git wasn’t build to server that purpose

Thank you Kevin! Got stuck and read this and bam! it helped

Community,
Is it possible to disable the “Having Trouble?” dialogue box?
I like to explore the commands as I learn them, so I often do things outside what the tutorial “expects”. It’s a tad bit irritating, however, that if I explore “too much” this dialogue box pops up and interrupts this process. Most often, I’m not having any trouble and just want to play with it!
Can someone please advise (if it is possible to do so) how I can disable this pop-up?
Many Thanks,
Chris

@boardsurfer19884
Apologies for the late response:
Unfortunately it is not possible to disable this pop up, to my knowledge.  I agree with you in the sense that you like to explore the commands as you learn them, and codecademy can block that.  A simple fix for you, put git onto your own computer and try to recreate the environment codecademy has provided for you as closely as possible, so you can have free reign over what commands you use and how you explore them.  I do this for many languages including python, java, and javascript.  Hope this helps.

Take a moment to consider the feedback you’re given by git and bash. They are telling you what you tried to do and why that isn’t possible, with that information, what is it that you need to adjust so that it matches what you are trying to do?

echo %cd% (source)(source2). Source2 also provides the set command. This allows you to create aliases, but they cease to exist the moment you exit cmd.
seem set is the equivalent of export (source). So aliases don’t exist in cmd

Either way, cmd is not so powerful. windows does have a decent shell (powershell), i heard good things about it, but by the time i did i was already addicted to bash

Is Codecademy ever adding a course with the other format?

For cmd? I don’t think so. I wouldn’t say CMD is crap, but it isn’t much good either.

True, but for beginners like me the command line is the only way we know to deploy a website, but as this site is developing that shouldn’t be top priority (It really needs a skill/lesson reset button if you forgot or broke it). Thanks for the help.

But the command line your learned is probably bash, it doesn’t “just” work for CMD. They are totally different things, it is like talking german to a Japanese person, it simple doesn’t work.

I am on question 12

Am I misunderstanding  something ?
","
Are you using git reset first 7 digits/letters of the commit BEFORE the one you want to delete?

And were there any error messages? If so, that’s telling you what is wrong.
As you can see below, what you describe will move you to the specified commit:
$ git log --oneline
50b7922 commit 2
409549d commit 1
$ git reset 409549d
$ git log --oneline
409549d commit 1
$

Working directory remains unchanged by the reset unless you add the option --hard (be careful with this)
And if you want to remove untracked files you can do this with git clean -f (again, be careful, use git clean -n first to see what it would remove, see git clean --help for what those options do)
The commits weren’t deleted though, you just moved HEAD to an earlier commit. You can find the old commits again with git reflog
If you just want to change the latest commit (and you haven’t pushed to anywhere yet) then you can commit with --amend to replace the last commit

What does this mean? If you’re having trouble thinking of a good commit message, reflect on how the project has changed since it began.
I understand that I need to type a message and how to do this, I just don’t know what they are exactly looking for.
","
I wrote git add .
and after git commit -m “first commit”

The example text hits the nail squarely on the head. “Add first line of dialogue” (paraphrase) as I recall.
The message should accurately describe what is in the commit. To be brief and succinct we need to use frank language in the present tense. It should be possible to go back through old commits and find when we added the first line of dialogue.

The instructions are not clear, but you need to specify to which file you make this commit and after that type your commit.
In this exact lesson you need to specify file name (scene-1.txt) and add commit as shown on example (Complete first line if the dialogue)

You want to avoid commit messages like “first commit”, “second commit”, “third commit” since they don’t really tell you anything about what changed.
It would be better to write “Change background color to green”, “Fix button layout on password screen”, “Add user information screen” which are more informative.
Hope that helped.

It hasn’t written out the prompt ($), it hasn’t loaded fully.
I don’t exactly have anything surgical to suggest as a solution, but it seems to be on your end since that exercise loads to completion on my side. So, my approach would be to switch out what you’re using to access the site.
Try changing to one or the other of firefox/chrome - I’ve had times where only one of them would work. It might also be that giving it a few more attempts at loading will do the trick.
If you’re behind a firewall, then that’s also something to consider. I usually turn to Tor to get around that kind of stuff.

Git is telling you why, your question suggests that you have not read the error message that it is providing you.
If you have read it, then you’ll have to elaborate on what it is you’re trying to do and why you think it should work and what thoughts you have on the error message.
You’ve got one explanation so you’ll have to explain what’s missing in it if you’re to ask for another!

I read it but I have tried committing it and it won’t allow me to commit

And it tells you why you may not commit it, doesn’t it?
That’s not in your screenshot, but if it’s not letting you commit, it’ll be telling you why! Follow those error messages.

it gives me this error when I commit

096d721d1afbab2a8cbf6611aa61f104daddfd93.png1280×1024


Okay… did you read THAT error? It says there are no changes to commit.
Have you figured out what you want to be doing with the file?
Git refuses to overwrite it because it isn’t saved anywhere else that it knows of. What do you want to do about that file? You always have to keep in mind what it is you’re trying to do otherwise you’re just… pulling levers with no intention and I don’t think that gets you anywhere and if it does then it’s by accident.

even when I change something and commit it I get the same error as before

But you didn’t commit it did you? Git told you there is nothing to commit, right?
You’ve got an unsaved file. You need to save or discard. You still haven’t said which of those you’re trying to do! You said you’re trying to commit, but as Git tells you, you haven’t told Git what to commit “no changes added to commit”

If you want to save your changes, then you’ll need to tell git that these are marked for commit, and then commit it.
If you want to discard it, simply delete the file.
You just have to decide on what you want to do.
My whole point here is that you have to decide what action you want to take. What do you intend? Nobody can tell you that. “Not working” is an insufficient problem description!

nevermind it works now

That’s great. But the important part here is to understand what Git is saying and how to respond to it!

git commit commits all files in the staging area (files in the staging area’s are files you specified with the git add command)
So, since git commit commits all files in the staging area you can simple do:
git commit -m ""some useful comment""

you can see which files are in the staging area with git status

sounds like you are in the wrong working directory, run the following command to see the files in the current directory:
ls

to see which directory you are currently in run:
pwd

use the following command to navigate to a folder:
cd foldername

where foldername is the name of the folder

2 posts were split to a new topic: 5. Not sure why it doesn’t work?

I have done it … you just have to write : $ git add score-1.txt

you have to type git add scene-1.txt

i did that and it didn’t work for me.

First initialize your git repository by typing
git init
Then do
git add scene-1.txt

You can try typing, “git add scene-1.txt” (enter) and “git status” (enter)
How I know…
For number 1. They asked to “Add scene-1.txt to the staging area in Git”, therefore “git add scene-1.txt”
For number 2. They told us to “Check the status of the project in Git”, therefore “git status”
This work perfectly fine for me.

Good answer, thank you.

this is how it should be written down
git add scene-1.txt

Thank you so much for your helping! it works!

i was stuck same place, thank you for your help

What foldername I should write? cd foldername
it showed me that I’m in /home/ccuser/workspace/sorcerers-code
but when I write:
$ git add score-1.txt
it is not work. There is a massege:
fatal: not a git repository

oh, it is started work when I pressed: get help - I want to restart this exirse
than I pressed F5

That is weird, there should be a git repository. Either way, i then suggest you then create one:
git init


Thanks mate that worked

Git has already suggested something, did you read that?

Yea I just started this up after taking a break for a while so I have no idea how to close down other processes.

Do you have knowledge of that there are any other processes? Otherwise, it suggests how to fix it.

I do not know of any other processes and what you see in the screenshot is all it tells me.

So you’re saying that there aren’t any git processes running. It says to make sure of that, and then to do something else

How do I make sure of that? I don’t see any other processes.

You said you haven’t quit while it was running and that it hasn’t crashed on you.
The lock file is essentially saying that git is running somewhere, but you will not be able to tell for certain because there might be another machine that’s doing it and you can’t search the processes of all machines that might be using that file system.
You can check your own:
pgrep -a git
But that seems unlikely if you can’t remember having quit while git was running, and even if it is running, it could be doing so on another machine, doubly unlikely.
Just delete it. Worst case you’ll have to reset, but most likely not.

Sorry I’m being so dumb, but how would I delete it?

There’s a program, or perhaps a built-in command in bash, by the name rm, so you would run rm with the file to remove as the argument
(I’d rather have you put the full command together by first having understood what it is you’re entering than giving you something to paste in)

$ git rm /home/ccuser/workspace/hamlet-prince-of-denmark/.git/index.lock
I tried this and it seems like it should work, but it give me the same error I keep getting (the one in the screenshot).

Well. Git does actually have its own rm too. But the program you are invoking there is git, not rm

Thanks so much, it worked! And now I know how to remove files.

You need to use the first 7 character of the SHA (each commit has a SHA string), so i would first show the commits:
git log

which for example will give:
commit 5d692065cf51a2f50ea8e7b19b5a7ae512f633ba

and then reset to a earlier commit:
git reset 5d692065cf

Your repo needs to be have knowledge of the other repo and to merge it also needs to posses the commits of the branch you’re merging into yours.
You probably just need to fetch:
git fetch origin
If origin is missing, then this should add it back:
git remote add origin ../science-quizzes
and then fetch again.

"
331,Can you push a local master branch to the remote repo?,"Get Help,Git",,4,"
In 6. Git Workflow the directions tell you to create a local branch bio-questions and later push bio-questions to the remote.
Instead of creating bio-questions branch, can you add biology.txt to the master branch and push the local master branch to the remote, using git push origin master ?
Is it more efficient/better to push a newly created branch instead of the master branch?
","
If you have a local repository, then that is also a branch, because it it’s branched from where you cloned it, right?
You then do some work on your branch, and push it back, they are merged.
You might want to sync the repositories without merging different branches though, so that’s when you would create a branch separate from master. You might be doing some feature that isn’t ready for anyone else to look at yet, but the master branch in the remote repo might have updated. They represent different things being worked on. The master branch might also be meant to always be in working order, the latest version.

Thanks for the explanation!
So it sounds like it’s better not to work directly on the master branch since changes can be made in the remote, is that right? A branch separate from master would represent a new feature, so if you merge this branch to the local master, that would totally defeat the purpose of working remotely, since the other collaborator can’t review this new feature.
After giving it some thought, I realized this question was kind of stupid 

And to actually answer the question, yes, you can push branches to another repo, names don’t even need to match.
And when that feature of yours is ready, what you’d do is to make sure that it doesn’t conflict with master (by merging master into your branch) and then let the owner know about it so that they can review and merge your changes into master (which is just a matter of fast-forwarding since you’ve already taken care of any conflicts)

Sorry, I did this yesterday and now it won’t show my work! Ugh! I will try to re-loop and get past it. If you pass this one, see if you can help me on my other post for the next step (step 6).
If a remember, git add went like this:
‘’‘git add _<_scene-1.txt>’’’

Yes the command should be git add then you can enter the first letters and press tab to autocomplete.

I could not see the output, where Git indicates the changes to be committed with “new file: scene-1.txt” in green text.

Because it doesn’t work

When we see something like this in a syntax key,
<file>
<filename>

It means type the file name with no quotes.
git add scene-1.txt

yeah im having the same problem…

I put like “git stage scene-1.txt”, and it works, but I really didn’t understand so much…
Oh, and the green text saying “new file: scene-1.txt” shows up too…

For now, let’s please stay in the confines of the course intro. There is more to come and we only really need to ‘git’ the current proceedings, without extrapolating beyond. Give that time. It would be inappropriate to discuss anything in this thread that has not come up in the lessons, and git stage has not come up yet.

If you’re still stuck on 6, type
git diff
and

to exit diff mode

Try this:
git add scene-1.txt
It worked with me.

That last bit is Step 5 - cannot do a partial commit during a merge. But I followed all instructions so I’m really confused. Does anyone know what I did wrong?
I went back two exercises and redid them, following instructions very carefully. But when I get to this Step 5 I’m still getting the error message. I used the command line to go back into the fencing branch, and commit there. Then it let me pass the exercise, but I can’t get past the next one - I got a similar error message. So the problem has to be in this exercise somewhere.
","
Hi @amandathewebdev, looks like you are very close to getting through this lesson! Nice work.
The reason you are getting the fatal: cannot do a partial commit during a merge. error is because you’re attempting to commit the file, resume.txt. This is not quite the correct syntax for Git. Instead, just do:
git commit -m ""Resolve merge conflict"" 

No mention of resume.txt is needed.
Let me know if this works for you!

I had this exact same issue. The instructions need to be clearer since we’ve been using ""git commit  -m “text” everywhere else.

Hi @dan_asselin, your suggestion worked. I’m not sure why “resume.txt” didn’t have to be included though if every other time I made a commit, I first added it by file name, then I listed the file(s) in the commit also and it worked. Did I not need to be doing that?
Thanks for your help!

Hi @amandathewebdev, correct. You did not need to be specifying the file in your commit because you already did that by adding the file to the staging area. Below is the syntax for committing with the -m option:
git commit -m ""Commit message 50 characters or less""

No need to specify the file :   )
Using the staging area to specify which file(s) you want to commit, then committing with the syntax shown in the code snippet above will get you through all of the exercises in the Codecademy Git course.
Hope this clarifies things. Feel free to ask more questions!

I blame Internet Explorer, please let me know if that’s the case so I can look down my nose on it and feel superior.
Either way, try another browser (Firefox/Chrome)
If that doesn’t do it I’d try connecting through the Tor network or some other proxy in case there’s something between me and Codecademy that could be interfering.
Essentially I would try to switch out the things I’m using to access the site - so that’s the browser and the network connection.
Obviously there’s the possibility that it was on Codecademy’s end, that would be a ‘try again later’ type of thing. It’s more likely that it’s on your end or between you though.

Hi- Like several other people, this section has left me stuck on this exercise for far too long. Everything works perfectly up to this point, including the Conflict in the previous exercise.

However, my screen is now covered with red telling me, “You should only have one branch: master.” I have repeated the entire section several times. I’ve done the last 3 sections over and over. I’m using the correct code. Output is telling me “fencing” is deleted. I only have one branch, and it’s the master branch. I see nothing else for me to do.

I resolved the issue myself. I reset the exercise (bottom right corner) AGAIN, and did the exercise without doing ANY of the extras under each instruction.

It sounds like it has lost your previous work.
You might have to reset this exercise and try again. Under the Get Help button there is an option called “I want to restart this exercise”.   Do that and then repeat the steps for this exercise.
If it still doesn’t work, go back one more exercise and reset and redo that exercise.




 albionsrefuge:

git merge origin/master


if git merge origin/master doesn’t work do git fetch first then git merge origin/master

The answer from @albionsrefuge is what fixed it for me. git fetch then git merge origin/master.

i was stuck in this one for 2 days!
my problem was solved exactly the way that @albionsrefuge said.
one step back to the git fetch and restart it.

Use git fetch before you git merge.
This exercise seems to be connected to the previous step. if you reset the exercise chances are that the git fetch from previous step is ignored hence you git fetch first then git merge. then continue to git log

For anyone else who runs into issues with this, go back to the previous step and start again but with some different text changes - took some effort but I got it to work again after going back to step 7 and starting over.

There is a bug in the code that is stopping us from moving on.  I was able to pass by “starting over” and rewriting all the steps.  I moved to the Fencing branch and made a change to the text and ran the program.  Than I added and committed it with a comment.  At this point I switched to the Master branch and merged.  It kept telling me I was wrong until I merged and allowed me to move onto step 3.  Hope that is not too confusing.  Let me know if you have any questions.

Yes, once I redid everything in this exercise, I was able to move on.  I finished the course shortly afterwards with no trouble whatsoever.

A post was split to a new topic: Cannot get passed the 6/10 $ git checkout master

This is what I did and it work.
 git add resume.txt then press 'enter'   on the keyboard                    
 git checkout serume.txt  press ‘enter’   on the keyboard
Once you done that, it automaticly do the work for step 3 and 4.  Therefore, you do not have to write anything for  step 3 and 4
Good luck

Sorry,  Ive made a litle silly mistake on the spelling.  It should be resume not serume.  Sorry about that

but how do you add the additional text?

this is my code
$ git add scene-1.txt Dumblediff: I should’ve known y
ou would be here, Professer McGonagit.

You shouldn’t write the additional text anywhere in the terminal. You add the text in the text editor, save the file and after that you write $ git add scene-1.txt

thank you sooo much it finally worked!!!

Do you mean stage two files with one command?

If you mean concatenating them together, then you would probably use cat, not git:

git checkout HEAD will restore the file in your working directory to look exactly as it did when you last made a commit. git reset HEAD This command will resets the file in the staging area to be the same as the HEAD commit. It does not discard file changes from the working directory, it just removes them from the staging area.

360,Git workflow problem,"Get Help,Git",,3,"
Hi, i have a problem with the 6/8 excercise of the Git Teamwork track.
The steps are these:
1.Enter this command:
$ cd my-quizzes
to change directories into the my-quizzes directory.
2.Enter the Git command:
$ git branch <branch_name>
to create a branch to develop questions for the biology quiz. Name the branch bio-questions.
Note: be careful to spell the name “bio-questions” exactly as it appears.

And here’s what im doing (the git shell):
 cd my-quizzes                                        
 git branch bio-questions
fatal: A branch named ‘bio-questions’ already exists.
$ git checkout bio-questions
Already on ‘bio-questions’
So i have already created the bio-questions branch like step 2 tells you to do, but it stays put and doesn’t let me go to the next step. Instead i get this message: Did you create a new branch called “bio-questions”? when i have already created the branch!

I also closed and reopened the browser - I’m using the latest Firefox.  When did that I was able to get the workspace to open for 4/8, but when I started typing in the terminal window, I got a popup congratulating me on completing the Git tutorial and earning a Git badge.  It would not let me exit and continue, the only option was click the link to view my achievements.  I then returned to the Git tutorial, but now the workspace is back to not loading…
","
:S
What I’d do:
Check my internet connection by pinging google every second for a while, particularly while trying to do this.
I’d then try another browser, perhaps codecademy isn’t agreeing with my configurations in firefox (addons etc)
If switching the browser didn’t do it, but the connection is stable, then I’d try to get a different route for the connection (avoid potential firewalls) you can use the tor-project for this, or some other proxy if you have one that you prefer

I ended up switching back to Internet Explorer (which I previously was having trouble with) and it loaded correctly.  Thanks for the reply.

Most of the it can be fixed simply by restarting browser or changing to something else.

362,Confusing Instructions in Exercise 5 - git reset I,"Get Help,Git",,5,"
Sorry but i don’t get the instructions, it confuses me. 

Great! The files you’ve added to the staging area belong in the same commit.


What if, before you commit, you accidentally delete an important line from scene-2.txt? Unthinkingly, you add scene-2.txt to the staging area. The file change is unrelated to the Larry/Laertes swap and you don’t want to include it in the commit.

Is the previous exercise somehow related to this one? The scene-2.txt wasn’t mentioned before, so i think it is completely unrelated, right? Or maybe i need to improve my english…
","
In this git project that you are working on there are several files.  In the terminal you can us the ls command to see them all.

I haven’t seen this posted anywhere so I thought I would put it up. I tried and and tried to get past step one but I just could not seem to get it right. I would copy and paste the required text in but it would give the error “Did you add the text to scene-1.txt?” It turns out that adding the text to line 2 of the text editor would not work. But adding the text to line three works fine. I wasted a lot of time on this exercise, and I feel that adding the text to line three aught to be specifically stated in the instructions.

There’s some button in the upper left that opens some file explorer…thingy.
If you can’t find it, or are up for an adventure, you could pull up an editor in the terminal!
So you could type:
nano file_to_open

and Ctrl - X will exit (and prompt for saving changes)
There’s also vim and perhaps emacs, which are both popular editors, but you may find them… difficult to use if you are not familiar with them whereas nano is much simpler.
vim is exited by (first hitting escape in case you have started a command) and then typing :q to quit or :wq to write and quit or :q! to force quit.
When you start vim, you’ll need to enter insert mode in order to type anything, that’s done by pressing i and once you’re done, esc will get you back out.
emacs is exited with Ctrl-X, Ctrl-C
Additionally, in the command line, you can use ls (list) to list files in current directory, and cat <file_name> (concatenate) to display a text file

Bad code checker 
To open files, you do that in the centre pane, in the Code Editor. Use the little folder icon.
You don’t need your git remote command until step 3.

I was getting the same issue. I just went back to the 2nd exercise (git clone) and reset it. Then I typed in the same thing: git clone science-quizzes my-quizzes
Pushed enter and then on the next exercise for whatever reason, inside the folder icon thingy, then I was able to see my files, whereas on the first time, even though I did absolutely nothing different, it wasn’t showing my files in the folder icon interface. It showed files inside science-quizzes folder, but not my-quizzes folder. But when I did it all again, then they showed… Just try it all again, it worked for me. Hope this helps

That did the trick. Thanks everyone

This website does a pretty good job of explaining the common commands: http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/

@sgt_3dboss that’s a really good question.
You’re correct. Git is not at all like JavaScript or HTML. Git’s purpose is to help you manage code projects that use programming languages (such as JavaScript and HTML). What you’re learning with Git is not a programming language, but a command-line application. (Learn more about the command line here)
To say more, code projects can get huge and complex, and Git allows you to:

keep track of changes made to a project over time
explore different directions or new features for a code project, then merge those changes back into the “master” version of the project.
Probably the most important, Git allows you to seamlessly work with multiple collaborators on a single code project

I hope this helps! Thanks for reaching out!

You’re basically given a unix shell in the user window.  Use   ls   to examine the files and directories in there.  I haven’t looked at the Git section for some time, but it’s not for someone who doesn’t know how to use Unix. You need to understand shell commands. If you’re just trying out this course because you’re curious and really don’t know Unix, look up shell commands on the web. If it bangs you out, you can simply restart it.

Hi, thanks for the reply. I know some basics in Unix and have been able to open the file using “vim file.txt” type command but that opens the file in the command line not the ‘code editor’ (center window). I can edit the file in the command line and progress but it’s not exactly what the task is asking for.

Yeah, I remember now, there’s another code editor that this course uses. You can find that name at the beginning of the course. So you use it similar to using vi to edit a file.

Ah ok, I must have missed that instruction along the line somewhere. Cheers.

the other text-editor you look for is nano, you can run: nano biology.txt
I am sure nano came along in this course earlier somewhere
You can use vim, but i think you experienced it is tricky. (the learning curve is really steep, but so worth it)

This is the problem.

you need to add files to the staging area (git add .) before you can commit anything, you can also do a shorthand, both commit and add in the same line:
git commit -a -m ""commit message""

the -a flag tells git add all files to the staging area

@stetim94 edited the question sry

can i see the output of git log? And a screenshot would also be really nice. If you reset to the latest commit, the latest commit isn’t deleted, it simple reset the staged files

@stetim94 added a screenshot

super weird, that should work. what if you try a earlier one:
git reset eaafdae505e61

i know, that are more then 7 char, but should work

@stetim94  OMG this thing is super super weird now after i tried reseting the second commit ‘the larry one’ and when i logged again it reseted my 1st commit anyway i can move on
thanks for your help

yes, that is the whole point of a reset. Later commits are deleted. Only if you reset to the latest commit, the commit stays, the files are simple unstaged (staged files are files you added with git add)

@stetim94 oh so reset sends you to the back in time to commit you mentioned in the command thnx…

Yes, which is really useful when you mess up big time, you can go back in time  that is why the commit messages are so important, so you remember what you did at which point, if you edit a lot of files, doing git diff can be a lot of work

387,Unable to learn when the work is irretractably done for me,"Get Help,Git",,3,"
Attempting to do the “Backtracking” part of the Git tutorial.
In exercise 1 I’m asked to add certain text to the file.
I have no idea how to do this.
I try a few lines in the terminal, like “git add …” and “git change …” and “git update …” but nothing works. I’m totally stumped. I keep clicking “Run” in order to try to get some help. Eventually I’m presented with either “Keep Working” or “Get Code”. I’m trying to get help, or a hint, or find a pointer to another section of Codecademy that will refresh my knowledge / inform me. When I click on “Get Code” I see an indication “Fetching Code” and suddenly the lesson is completed for me. I haven’t learned the new information, and no matter what I do I apparently can’t “undo” this “Get Code” effect. I’ve tried logging out and logging back in to Codecademy, but the lesson stays irretractably completed, and I have no idea what I was supposed to learn from it.
There are two hints now available in the left pane:

From the terminal, add scene-5.txt to the staging area.
Here’s a hint on how to do it.
-and-
Commit the changes to the repository with a good commit message.
Here’s a hint on how to do it.

The “hint” for the first option links to exercise 5 of the “Basic Git Workflow” lesson, but attempting to do that lesson, or indeed attempting to use the information provided there back in the previous exercise, fails. In the current exercise I type “git add scene-5.txt” and apparently it’s alright, as no error message is produced. But then typing “git commit -m “added ghost text to the file”” produces

On branch master
nothing to commit, working directory clean

I’ve proceeded to exercise 3 (“git checkout”) this way, and the same thing happened. I was unclear on how to achieve what was expected, namely “Change the ghost’s words in some way.” I tried “git alter …” and “git change …” and “git update …” and knew I was getting nowhere. I kept trying the guessing game until finally the options popped up again “Keep Trying” or “Get Code”. Clicking the “Get Code” option, once again, apparently finished the exercise for me, and I have no idea what I’m supposed to know or have learned at this stage.
Also, not only is the lesson apparently completed (all checkboxes on the left pane are now filled in), and not only can I not “undo” this effect in order to try to actually learn the lesson, but any of the further instructions produce no results. I.e. following the instruction “From the terminal, use git diff to see the difference between scene-5.txt as it appears in the working directory vs. how it appears in your last commit.” – typing into the terminal “git diff” produces zero results, just returns to a blank prompt. Equally, typing “git checkout HEAD scene-5.txt” also produces zero results.
It would be great if there were some kind of hint(s) for how to proceed, rather than just secretly finishing a given exercise for the student without any further information provided.

no matter what I do I apparently can’t “undo” this “Get Code” effect.

 personguy:

In exercise 1 I’m asked to add certain text to the file.

The right hand pane is the terminal. We are using that to issue git commands. git can add a file to the snapshot of your project but git can not edit your file.
Your text editor is the middle pane.
Let’s get back to the earliest exercise where you are having a problem and go from there.

Many thanks for the prompt reply.
I’ve since “dialed in” and realised that references to the “Code Editor” refer to the pane in the middle of the screen, and clicking “Run” is the equivalent of “saving” the text that is written into that file, though it not be a code.
Thank you for the tip on how to restart the exercise.
I did return to other Git lessons to get a better handle on what I was missing.
I still don’t understand why the “git status” commands were producing the wrong results, but for now this does get me back on track.

391,6. git diff ISSUES on step 3,"Get Help,Git",,14,"
Ok, this one is giving me a challenge.  There are three steps and I have the first two completed (shown below) :

I added the “Dumblediff…” in the code editor in scene-1.txt (pass)
I entered ‘’‘git diff’’’ to the terminal (pass)
HOWEVER…
Step 3: Add the changes to the staging areas in Git. Recall that you will need to identify the file by its name.
My wrong entry: git diff _<_scene-1.txt> (FAIL)

Any help is most appreciated.  Getting frustrated…
","
maybe without the <>? I guess this is just manual use of arbitrary file name

EDIT: SOLVED TRY ENTERING THIS CODE IN THE TERMINAL git update-ref scene-1.txt try this

Try this code in terminal: git add scene-1.txt

Figured it out. Don’t ask me how though 
But seriously that step was particularly challenging (everything else was OK).  This is why I prefer the ‘Programming Languages’ as opposed to the ‘Web Developer Skills’ tutorials.  I wish they would add Java, C++, and C#. Maybe one day.

tryout Python. U  will  it

There is a start of a java track here:
https://www.codecademy.com/en/courses/learn-java
Also git is not about web development only but about version control.

I also get the same problen in git diff step 3: Add the changes to the staging area in Git. Recall that you will need to identify the file by its name.
what code should i try out in the terminal

“git add .” this command helps to complete step 3 in git diff

I typed $git diff then let it run then for step 3 i used $git add scene-1.txt

I typed

$git diff scene-1.txt
then let it run then
press q from your keyboard to exit from diff mode.
$git add scene-1.txt


First in the code editor, copy the  text -  Dumblediff: I should’ve known you would be here, Professor McGonagit.
step 2 in the terminal -   git add scene-1.txt
then step 3 -   git diff scene-1.txt

they have added java

Thats true
Python is also easy too.

You can do it manually, but there is a command (assuming you are in the directory which contains the file):

you enter this in the command line, just like the git command.i am not sure it is scene-7.txt, if it is not, replace scene-7.txt wit the desired file (scene-3.txt?). sed is not related to git, and is not covered in this course. quick break down of the command:
sed is a stream editor for filtering and transforming text
the -i options allows you to read and write to the same file
`s/Larry/Leartes/g’ is the tricky bit, the s is from substitute, then Larry is what you want to replace, Leartes is what you want to replace it with, g indicates global (which means it will alter all occasions, not only the first) and scene-7.txt is the file you want to execute the substitution on.
you can enter:

You want a message that will help you know what was in that particular commit. For example, after you have 50 commits, and you want to find the one where you changed all the LARRY to whatever that was, it would be easier on you, and anyone else working on that repo,  if the commit says “changed all the LARRY to …”, instead of “commit 22” or “a bunch of changes”.

And you must put me in your heart for friend,
Sith you have heard, and with a knowing ear,
That he which hath your noble father slain
Pursued my life.
LARRY
It well appears: but tell me
Why you proceeded not against these feats,
So crimeful and so capital in nature,
As by your safety, wisdom, all things else,
You mainly were stirr’d up.
KING CLAUDIUS
O, for two special reasons;
Which may to you, perhaps, seem much unsinew’d,
But yet to me they are strong. The queen his mother
Lives almost by his looks; and for myself–
My virtue or my plague, be it either which–
She’s so conjunctive to my life and soul,
That, as the star moves not but in his sphere,
I could not but by her. The other motive,
Why to a public count I might not go,
Is the great love the general gender bear him;
Who, dipping all his faults in their affection,
Would, like the spring that turneth wood to stone,
Convert his gyves to graces; so that my arrows,
Too slightly timber’d for so loud a wind,
Would have reverted to my bow again,
And not where I had aim’d them.
LARRY
And so have I a noble father lost;
A sister driven into desperate terms,
Whose worth, if praises may go back again,
Stood challenger on mount of all the age
For her perfections: but my revenge will come.

i don’t know what to do.
Can somebody help me?
Here is the question:From the terminal, type the command to reset to a previous commit, using the first 7 characters of one of the commit SHAs in your Git log.
My code what i am doing:
git reset commit_82f927d
Then it says Fatal: that i need to use --?
then it says use this git command revision – file.
Pls help

Same problem.  Maybe a bug?

I did just use “git reset SHA” and that seemed to work.  Don’t know if it had the desired effect, but it allowed me to progress at least.

Hi @vincent0302. You’re so close! You actually don’t need the word “commit” or the underscore _ in reset commit_82f927d. The code below will suffice (as long as those 7 digits come from one of the commit SHAs that you got from the git log output.
git reset 82f927d

Hope this helps!
Best,
Dan

Trying to find the terminal


The terminal is the right most pane, you should have a $ prompt there.
To enter diff mode, type: git diff
To exit diff mode, press q

number 3. i typed git diff scene 1.txt in the terminal, but it keeps showing a failure. am I supposed to type something else? btw thanks for the help.




 frankieperez:

number 3. i typed git diff scene 1.txt


Step 3 is asking you to add the file, not check for differences. Those are two different git commands.

by adding the file,does it mean to just add scene-1.txt?




 frankieperez:

just add scene-1.txt?


Almost. You always have to put the word git first, then the rest of the command.

like git add scene-1.txt?




 frankieperez:

like git add scene-1.txt?


Yes, that’s right…

When you are in diff mode, your terminal window will looks something like this, with (END) on the last line:

After you press q on your keyboard you will get your $ prompt back which means that you are out of diff mode.

Just press q on your keyboard when (END) shows.

Hi Minecraftlons,
The command to add something to the staging area is:
$ git add <filename>

So in this case, you would run:
$ git add scene-5.txt

Lesson before
git status

Git sees the file but has not started tracking changes yet, you get a red message.
Now we add the file
git add scene-1.txt

With
git status 

You can see the file is now green and git tracked changes
