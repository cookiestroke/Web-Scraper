What does “character number” mean? As in “The second number ( 3 ) tells us the character number in which the error lives on that line.”

It tells you the number of characters, starting from the left, where the error shows up.
fun main() {
  printlnn(""An error a day keeps the programmer away."")
}

In this case, it tells you 3 because starting on line 2, from the very left, you have two spaces and then the letter p, which accounts for the third character, and thus your number (3). As our error is part of the entire println, it tells you where it begins. If you were to remove the closing parenthesis, for example, the error would be at character 54.
