I have been working on this lesson for quite a while. I will create my personal-website directory but it doesn’t show up in the next lesson. Here is one possibility as to why: “just make sure that your HTML is inside of a file called index.html. As you’ll see, even Jekyll uses a file called index.html.”. Anything I type is in a bash file. How do I get my directory into the index.html so that it will show in the next lesson and I can complete this course? Thank you for your help.

Why do I have a dot (.) before a class name when selecting an element, but not when adding or removing it’s class?

When you select an HTML element, there are three main ways you can do that. By it’s tag name (tag), by one of it’s classes (.class), or by it’s id (#id). So, with these elements:
<div></div>
<div class=""example-class""></div>
<div id=""example-id""></div>

(the class or id name could be anything you want it to be)
you would select each element like this with jQuery, respectively:
$('div')
$('.example-class')
$('#example-id')

The character in front of your selection (nothing, ., or #) represents what selector it is. This is necessary because you might have a class name that’s the same as a tag name, for some reason.
However, addClass(), removeClass(), and toggleClass() don’t need that distinction. They know they’re dealing with a class, so the distinction between the various selectors isn’t necessary.

Why am I told to select the <div> with the description class when there is only a <div> with the description row class?

In the class attribute on an HTML element, a space represents two different classes. So here:
<div class=""description row"">
  <!-- ... -->
</div>

the <div> has two classes, description and row. Not one class called “description row”.
You can have as many classes as you like (within reason) on an element, as long as you separate each different class name by a space.

Additional Reading

class
The class global attribute is a space-separated list of the classes of the element. Classes allows CSS and Javascript to select and access specific elements via the class selectors or functions like the DOM method document.getElementsByClassName.

Hi there,
I just wanted to know if it is possible to assign an html element to 2 or more classes like this :
<h1 class=""page-title"" class=""sub-ref"">TUNDRA GALLERY</h1>

Above, the ‘h1’ element is assigned to two classes by the name “page-title” and “sub-ref”. I just want to know if this is allowed in HTML.
If it is allowed, then could someone explain how I could create a CSS selector for that particular element above.
Thank you.

Thankfully there is a tool for that:
https://validator.w3.org/nu/#textarea
i put this code in:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang=""en"">
<head>
  <meta charset=""utf-8"">
  <meta name=""viewport"" content=""width=device-width"">
  <title>test</title>
</head>
<body>
 <h1 class=""page-title"" class=""sub-ref"">TUNDRA GALLERY</h1>
</body>
</html>

otherwise we get a lot of other warnings/errors
as we can see, we get an error (duplicate attribute)
an element can have multiple classes, but only a single class attribute. Simply give the class attribute multiple values (space separated)

Thank you.  So does that mean I can do something like this:
<h1 class=""page-title"" ""sub-ref"">TUNDRA GALLERY</h1>

Instead of :
<h1 class=""page-title"" class=""sub-ref"">TUNDRA GALLERY</h1>

Once again, Thank you for the quick reply.




 natarior:

Thank you. So does that mean I can do something like this:
<h1 class=""page-title"" ""sub-ref"">TUNDRA GALLERY</h1>



almost, did you put that code through the validator/w3c tool i put in my previous reply? Then you would have know it was not correct
when we have an attribute with its value:
attribute=""value""

the value is between the quotation marks. If we want to have multiple values, all values should be between the quotation marks (separated by spaces)

Sorry if I took to long to see this. Makes more sense to have values within the quotes.
Thank you.
So do you have any idea on how I could create a CSS selector for this particular element ? :
<h1 class=""page-title sub-ref"">TUNDRA GALLERY</h1>

Thank you once more.




 natarior:

So do you have any idea on how I could create a CSS selector for this particular element ? :


that depends on the other elements in your code, if you truly want it be unique, use id

.contact-btn a { 
  position: relative;
}

Instead of putting position attribute here , Why not put position: relative; in the .contact-btn a:active selector like this
.contact-btn a:active {
   position: relative;
  top: 2px;
}


[QUESTION]
Hi, about the example code in this lesson that reads:
.container {
  position: relative; 
  top: 10px; 
  left: 20px;
}

I was wondering about its similarities with the following:
.container {
  margin-top: 10px;
  margin-left: 20px;
}

So, is there a difference in these two ways of coding? If so, what is it?
Thanks in advance.
Cheers. David.

The first example does not change the size of the box, only shifts it right and down. If it has a parent container, it may overflow that box.
The second example does change the size of the box. It does not overflow its parent viewport.

Hello! I have a question on the inline vs block display of the 7.Keep it inline lesson.
The HTML file for the nav bar reads:
<nav>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Arctic</b></a></li>
        <li>Alpine</a></li>
        <li>Antarctic</a></li>
      </ul>
      <div class=""contact-btn""><a>Contact</a>
      </div>
    </nav>

So nav ul contains nav li.
In the CSS file nav ul is styled - display: inline; - but the results of the code is still a block display. Only when nav li is styled inline then the display changes. So, as nav ul contains nav li, why is that that the display doesn’t change to inline?
Thanks for your help!

where do you find a websites directory on github pages

Hello,
I don’t understand how to use the “cd” command to navigate to my site’s directory. 

For example you have a directory:
Desktop:
     Images:
          Cloudes.png
          Shadows.jpg
     Videos:
          Funny:
              Skatboarding-fail
          Sad:
              Cat's funeral
     Programmes:
          HTML.html
          JS.js
          CSS.css

Okay so you are in images folder,
You can go back using cd ..
Then you want to go to funny folder inside videos so you can do this in one command: cd Videos/Funny
Or you can do it in two commands: cd Videos (On a new line)
cd Funny
You could do it in one command  cd ../Videos/Funny
And if like you are in Sad folder inside videos and you want to get to the Desktop: cd ../.. firstly it backs to videos folder then to the desktop folder
Hope this helps to understand the cd command 

Thank you very much for your help ! Now I can peacefully continue my exercise 

Hi, I want to create my website from scratch instead of using Jekyll. How do I use GitHub in  this scenario?
I already have all my codes?

Step 2 is really simple, but not working. I type “git init” and hit enter and the terminal initializes, but the little box next to step 2 doesn’t turn into a green checkmark or a red X. It just turns to a grey X that I can’t do anything with.

Add ‘personal-website/’ after ‘git init’. It took me awhile to figure that out but it worked and I would guess is correct since I got a green checkmark box. I had a similar problem in another exercise where the only instruction was to type ‘cd’ but the terminal needed additional information.

Its doesnt work! So I write
-git init
-mkdir personal-website
-cd personal-website
And next button doesn`t work

I think this is a bug. The solution - get Help button in the lower right corner of the browser

Isn’t the correct order of the commands,


cd personal-website


git init


?

In my own command line, when i write “git init” i get ‘git’ is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.
How do i initialize the git file?

Yes git init is not working after using mkdir personal-website and then cd personal-website/  and then git init still not working

I’m a bit confused on what the “type” function does. What do I use when inserting one of my personal videos?

Is it necessary to use the “source” tag?
Can I simply use the “src” attribute inside the “video” tag?

It depends on the format (extension) of this video file. The most popular video MIME types are video/webm (for .webm files) and video/ogg (for files .ogg and .ogv). But it is really easy to find the correct MIME type for given file extension using a search engine.

Yeah, sure, you can 
source elements are really important when you want to make sure that your video will be correctly displayed in all web browsers. Web browsers do not support every MIME type. By using source elements you are able to provide your video in a few different MIME types which allows you to widen the range of supported web browsers.

I need help with this part because I have been stuck on part four for days. I just can’t seem to understand what it wants me to do, and how to do it. I have to do these courses for school, and this assignment is due soon. Could you help me? 

This is a  crappy course - actually the terminal is super slow to begin with - almost two decades old - you need to type alphabet by alphabet and still even if you cd into the folder and ran jekyll serve the instructions wont let you proceed forward. The popups are f***ing annoying for a typical developer. I am totally pissed of with this stupid course already.

This exercise and this course is broken.
In the portion where you create the site with jekyll ‘jekyll new personal-website’, change to the site directory ‘cd personal-website’, and execute ‘jekyll serve’, it gives me the following error message:
/home/ccuser/.gem/ruby/2.3.0/gems/mercenary-0.3.6/lib/mercenary/program.rb:31:
in `go': invalid argument: --port  (OptionParser::InvalidArgument)
from /home/ccuser/.gem/ruby/2.3.0/gems/mercenary-0.3.6/lib/mercenary.rb:19:in `program'
from /home/ccuser/.gem/ruby/2.3.0/gems/jekyll-3.1.3/bin/jekyll:13:in `<top (required)>'
from /home/ccuser/.bin/jekyll:30:in `load'
from /home/ccuser/.bin/jekyll:30:in `<main>'


I am stuck at the same step.  It is no use continuing. This broken course was reported months ago. Who is fixing this course?

I got this to work, kind of.  If you install jekyll on your pc, and use that to do the steps up to the “serve” command, you can then cd to the directory “personal-site”, and type "" jekyll serve "", and get something like:
lt@lt-desktop:~/demonfinder$ jekyll serve
Configuration file: /home/lt/demonfinder/_config.yml
Source: /home/lt/demonfinder
Destination: /home/lt/demonfinder/_site
Incremental build: disabled. Enable with --incremental
Generating…
done in 0.34 seconds.
Auto-regeneration: enabled for ‘/home/lt/demonfinder’
Configuration file: /home/lt/demonfinder/_config.yml
Server address: http://127.0.0.1:4000/
Server running… press ctrl-c to stop.
( obviously I named my site "" demonfinder"" rather than "" personal-site"". )
Next, go to your browser, and type in “http://localhost:4000”
There, you should see a page like was shown earlier in the course, that says "" Welcome to jekyll"" and has a page title of “your awesome site”.
Hope that helps!
-LT




 code4111957450:

use that to do the steps up to the “serve”


… wat?

it’s clearly showing some errors in ruby files, even tho I’ve name project as they wanted…

Why does “display: inline” doesn’t horizontally align the images in this exercise?

I was wondering the same thing. Doing this course after the HTML/CSS ones has mostly been review but display: flex; is the first topic that wasn’t covered in the CSS course at all - we only learned about other display  values such a inline, block, and inline-block, none of which seem to have any impact on this page when used instead of flex.
I did some experimenting and it looks like the key difference has to do with parent/child element relationships.
HTML:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

<link href=""./test.css"" type=""text/css"" rel=""stylesheet"">

<!--TESTING SPACE-->

<div class=""rectangle"">
	<p>I'm a rectangle!</p>
</div>
<div class=""rectangle"">
	<p>So am I!</p>
</div>
<div class=""rectangle"">
	<p>Me three!</p>
</div>

<div class=""parent"">
	<p>I'm the first child!</p>
	<p>I'm the second!</p>
	<p>I'm the third!</p>
</div>

<!--TESTING SPACE-->

</html>

CSS:
.rectangle {
	border: 2px solid blue;
	width: 200px;
	height: 300px;
	display: inline-block;
}

.parent {
	margin-top: 10px;
	display: flex;
}

.parent p {
	border: 2px solid red;
	width: 200px;
	height: 300px;
}

Render:
image1413×944 7.7 KB
Changing display to flex for the “rectangle” class had no effect, so that tells me that flex is only useful on container elements. On the other hand, changing display to inline-block for the “parent” class created some strange layout changes that I can’t explain.
Hopefully this helps someone!

Hey! I am doing this for the first time, so forgive any mistakes.
I am currenyly doing the “building with bootstrap” lesson and couldn’t help wondering: is what I am currently doing “inline CSS”? As all the customisations seem to be done on the HTML page and not the external css one.
Thanks for any replies!

From the lesson overview page (can’t find the link!), the image of the 12-column grid included .col-span-3 class names. Since these are classes that Bootstrap gives CSS for, you assign the class and the CSS to make it span 3 columns happens.
It should work just the same as if you wrote the styling in your own CSS file for
.col-span-3 {column-span: 3;} yourself, right? (My apologies for any syntax errors!)
I’m just a noob too, so same disclaimer here: I could be totally wrong.
If we’re assigning classes like ‘text-right’ and ‘row’, I expect these are also styled to match.
.text-right {
  align-text: right;
}
/* and */
.row {
  row-span: 100%; /* tho this one feels incorrect */
}

(These might need to be some grid ‘justify-item’ -type declaration in the parent container. I’m still struggling with CSS grids generally, tbf.)
I think it isn’t inline CSS since we’re not applying any styles in the HTML, we’re just applying class properties. These act like shorthand styling so it’s more like linking to a stylesheet (like regular CSS you write yourself) than adding style as a property?
Inline CSS would be:
<div style=""font-weight: bold;""> ... </div>
(<element style=""property: value;""> is roughly correct! I checked with a coworker.)

In the example for the lesson, a container class is included under the jumbotron class like this:
<section class=""jumbotron"">
   <div class=""container"">
  ... 
   </div>
</section>

Why not just make the section a container? What is the point of the jumbotron class if all the child elements are under a container class?

Jumbotron can be used without a container but here in the lesson CC is making you style with it as the result is different and they are aiming for that outcome.
Please read Bootstrap document to get an understanding: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/components/jumbotron/



 corinnemiller0149215:

Why not just make the section a container?


having multiple classes on one element with contradicting styling is never a good idea and most likely won’t work.

Why do we need to create separate  tags for the “container” class and the “row text-center” class? Here is the code:


Thanks
(link: https://www.codecademy.com/courses/make-a-website/lessons/bootstrap/exercises/jumbotron?action=resume_content_item)




In the fragment:
<section class=""jumbotron"">
  <div class=""container"">
    <div class=""row text-center"">
      <h2>Homemade Goods</h2>
      <h3>This Year's Best</h3>
      <a class=""btn btn-primary"" href=""#"" role=""button"">See all</a>
    </div>
  </div>
</section>

why was role=""button"" attribute used?

I was wondering the same thing. I think it’s confusing here because there is only that one <div> child, but in theory when building an actual website you might have a background image or something that you want to span the whole width of the webpage. Changing that <section> element to class=""container"" would limit its contents to only taking up the 12 columns.
I thought of it as the section is the whole jumbotron, the first container div is a 12-column-wide box within the jumbotron, and then the subsequent row div is the first line in that 12-column-wide box.
Hope that helps!

We didn’t learn a single thing about buttons in this lesson lol unless you count having them thrown into the code as part of the jumbotron exercise?
